    <h2>
      CHAPTER I. &mdash; THE KING'S PLEASAUNCE
    </h2>
    <p>
      "In the beginning," so we are told, "God made the heavens and the earth."
    </p>
    <p>
      The statement is simple and terse; it is evidently intended to be wholly
      comprehensive. Its decisive, almost abrupt tone would seem to forbid
      either question or argument. The old-world narrator of the sublime event
      thus briefly chronicled was a poet of no mean quality, though moved by the
      natural conceit of man to give undue importance to the earth as his own
      particular habitation. The perfect confidence with which he explains 'God'
      as making 'two great lights, the greater light to rule the day, the lesser
      light to rule the night,' is touching to the verge of pathos; and the
      additional remark which he throws in, as it were casually,&mdash;'He made
      the stars also,' cannot but move us to admiration. How childlike the
      simplicity of the soul which could so venture to deal with the
      inexplicable and tremendous problem of the Universe! How self-centred and
      sure the faith which could so arrange the work of Infinite and Eternal
      forces to suit its own limited intelligence! It is easy and natural to
      believe that 'God,' or an everlasting Power of Goodness and Beauty called
      by that name, 'created the heavens and the earth,' but one is often
      tempted to think that an altogether different and rival element must have
      been concerned in the making of Man. For the heavens and the earth are
      harmonious; man is a discord. And not only is he a discord in himself, but
      he takes pleasure in producing and multiplying discords. Often, with the
      least possible amount of education, and on the slightest provocation, he
      mentally sets Himself, and his trivial personal opinion on religion,
      morals, and government, in direct opposition to the immutable laws of the
      Universe, and the attitude he assumes towards the mysterious Cause and
      Original Source of Life is nearly always one of three things;
      contradiction, negation, or defiance. From the first to the last he
      torments himself with inventions to outwit or subdue Nature, and in the
      end dies, utterly defeated. His civilizations, his dynasties, his laws,
      his manners, his customs, are all doomed to destruction and oblivion as
      completely as an ant-hill which exists one night and is trodden down the
      next. Forever and forever he works and plans in vain; forever and forever
      Nature, the visible and active Spirit of God, rises up and crushes her
      puny rebel.
    </p>
    <p>
      There must be good reason for this ceaseless waste of human life,&mdash;this
      constant and steady obliteration of man's attempts, since there can be no
      Effect without Cause. It is, as if like children at a school, we were set
      a certain sum to do, and because we blunder foolishly over it and add it
      up to a wrong total, it is again and again wiped off the blackboard, and
      again and again rewritten for our more careful consideration. Possibly the
      secret of our failure to conquer Nature lies in ourselves, and our own
      obstinate tendency to work in only one groove of what we term
      'advancement,'&mdash;namely our material self-interest. Possibly we might
      be victors if we would, even to the very vanquishment of Death!
    </p>
    <p>
      So many of us think,&mdash;and so thought one man of sovereign influence
      in this world's affairs as, seated on the terrace of a Royal palace
      fronting seaward, he pondered his own life's problem for perhaps the
      thousandth time.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is the use of thinking?" asked a wit at the court of Louis XVI. "It
      only intensifies the bad opinion you have of others,&mdash;or of
      yourself!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He found this saying true. Thinking is a pernicious habit in which very
      great personages are not supposed to indulge; and in his younger days he
      had avoided it. He had allowed the time to take him as it found him, and
      had gone with it unresistingly wherever it had led. It was the best way;
      the wisest way; the way Solomon found most congenial, despite its end in
      'vanity and vexation of spirit.' But with the passing of the years a veil
      had been dropped over that path of roses, hiding it altogether from his
      sight; and another veil rose inch by inch before him, disclosing a new and
      less joyous prospect on which he was not too-well-pleased to look.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sea, stretching out in a broad shining expanse opposite to him,
      sparkled dancingly in the warm sunshine, and the snowy sails of many
      yachts and pleasure-boats dipped now and again into the glittering waves
      like white birds skimming over the tiny flashing foam-crests. Dazzling and
      well-nigh blinding to his eyes were the burning glow and exquisite
      radiance of colour which seemed melted like gold and sapphire into that
      bright half-circle of water and sky,&mdash;beautiful, and full of a
      dream-like evanescent quality, such as marks all the loveliest scenes and
      impressions of our life on earth. There was a subtle scent of violets in
      the air,&mdash;and a gardener, cutting sheafs of narcissi from the edges
      of the velvety green banks which rolled away in smooth undulations upward
      from the terrace to the wider extent of the palace pleasaunce beyond,
      scattered such perfume with his snipping shears as might have lured
      another Proserpine from Hell. Cluster after cluster of white blooms,
      carefully selected for the adornment of the Royal apartments, he laid
      beside him on the grass, not presuming to look in the direction where that
      other Workman in the ways of life sat silent and absorbed in thought. That
      other, in his own long-practised manner, feigned not to be aware of his
      dependant's proximity,&mdash;and in this fashion they twain&mdash;human
      beings made of the same clay and relegated, to the same dust&mdash;gave
      sport to the Fates by playing at Sham with Heaven and themselves. Custom,
      law, and all the paraphernalia of civilization, had set the division and
      marked the boundary between them,&mdash;had forbidden the lesser in
      world's rank to speak to the greater, unless the greater began
      conversation,&mdash;had equally forbidden the greater to speak to the
      lesser lest such condescension should inflate the lesser's vanity so much
      as to make him obnoxious to his fellows. Thus,&mdash;of two men, who, if
      left to nature would have been merely&mdash;men, and sincere enough at
      that,&mdash;man himself had made two pretenders,&mdash;the one as
      gardener, the other as&mdash;King! The white narcissi lying on the grass,
      and preparing to die sweetly, like sacrificed maiden-victims of the
      flower-world, could turn true faces to the God who made them,&mdash;but
      the men at that particular moment of time had no real features ready for
      God's inspection,&mdash;only masks.
    </p>
    <p>
      "C'est mon metier d'être Roi!" So said one of the many dead and gone
      martyrs on the rack of sovereignty. Alas, poor soul, thou would'st have
      been happier in any other 'métier' I warrant! For kingship is a profession
      which cannot be abandoned for a change of humour, or cast aside in light
      indifference and independence because a man is bored by it and would have
      something new. It is a routine and drudgery to which some few are born,
      for which they are prepared, to which they must devote their span of life,
      and in which they must die. "How shall we pass the day?" asked a weary
      Roman emperor, "I am even tired of killing my enemies!"
    </p>
    <p>
      'Even' that! And the strangest part of it is, that there are people who
      would give all their freedom and peace of mind to occupy for a few years
      an uneasy throne, and who actually live under the delusion that a monarch
      is happy!
    </p>
    <p>
      The gardener soon finished his task of cutting the narcissi, and though he
      might not, without audacity, look at his Sovereign-master, his
      Sovereign-master looked at him, furtively, from under half-closed eyelids,
      watching him as he bound the blossoms together carefully, with the view of
      giving as little trouble as possible to those whose duty it would be to
      arrange them for the Royal pleasure. His work done, he walked quickly, yet
      with a certain humble stealthiness,&mdash;thus admitting his consciousness
      of that greater presence than his own,&mdash;down a broad garden walk
      beyond the terrace towards a private entrance to the palace, and there
      disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      The King was left alone,&mdash;or apparently so, for to speak truly, he
      was never alone. An equerry, a page-in-waiting,&mdash;or what was still
      more commonplace as well as ominous, a detective,&mdash;lurked about him,
      ever near, ever ready to spring on any unknown intruder, or to answer his
      slightest call.
    </p>
    <p>
      But to the limited extent of the solitude allowed to kings, this man was
      alone,&mdash;alone for a brief space to consider, as he had informed his
      secretary, certain documents awaiting his particular and private perusal.
    </p>
    <p>
      The marble pavilion in which he sat had been built by his father, the late
      King, for his own pleasure, when pleasure was more possible than it is
      now. Its slender Ionic columns, its sculptured friezes, its painted
      ceilings, all expressed a gaiety, grace and beauty gone from the world,
      perchance for ever. Open on three sides to the living picture of the
      ocean, crimson and white roses clambered about it, and tall plume-like
      mimosa shook fragrance from its golden blossoms down every breath of wind.
      The costly table on which this particular Majesty of a nation occasionally
      wrote his letters, would, if sold, have kept a little town in food for a
      year,&mdash;the rich furs at his feet would have bought bread for hundreds
      of starving families,&mdash;and every delicious rose that nodded its
      dainty head towards him with the breeze would have given an hour's joy to
      a sick child. Socialists say this kind of thing with wildly eloquent
      fervour, and blame all kings in passionate rhodomontade for the tables,
      the furs and the roses,&mdash;but they forget&mdash;it is not the sad and
      weary kings who care for these or any luxuries,&mdash;they would be far
      happier without them. It is the People who insist on having kings that
      should be blamed,&mdash;not the monarchs themselves. A king is merely the
      people's Prisoner of State,&mdash;they chain him to a throne,&mdash;they
      make him clothe himself in sundry fantastic forms of attire and exhibit
      his person thus decked out, for their pleasure,&mdash;they calculate,
      often with greed and grudging, how much it will cost to feed him and keep
      him in proper state on the national premises, that they may use him at
      their will,&mdash;but they seldom or never seem to remember the fact that
      there is a Man behind the King!
    </p>
    <p>
      It is not easy to govern nowadays, since there is no real autocracy, and
      no strong soul likely to create one. But the original idea of sovereignty
      was grand and wise;&mdash;the strongest man and bravest, raised aloft on
      shields and bucklers with warrior cries of approval from the people who
      voluntarily chose him as their leader in battle,&mdash;their utmost Head
      of affairs. Progress has demolished this ideal, with many others equally
      fine and inspiring; and now all kings are so, by right of descent merely.
      Whether they be infirm or palsied, weak or wise, sane or crazed, still are
      they as of old elected; only no more as the Strongest, but simply as the
      Sign-posts of a traditional bygone authority. This King however, here
      written of, was not deficient in either mental or physical attributes. His
      outward look and bearing betokened him as far more fit to be lifted in
      triumph on the shoulders of his battle-heroes, a real and visible Man,
      than to play a more or less cautiously inactive part in the modern
      dumb-show of Royalty. Well-built and muscular, with a compact head regally
      poised on broad shoulders, and finely formed features which indicated in
      their firm modelling strong characteristics of pride, indomitable
      resolution and courage, he had an air of rare and reposeful dignity which
      made him much more impressive as a personality than many of his
      fellow-sovereigns. His expression was neither foolish nor sensual,&mdash;his
      clear dark grey eyes were sane and steady in their regard and had no
      tricks of shiftiness. As an ordinary man of the people his appearance
      would have been distinctive,&mdash;as a King, it was remarkable.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had of course been called handsome in his childhood,&mdash;what heir to
      a Throne ever lived that was not beautiful, to his nurse at least?&mdash;and
      in his early youth he had been grossly flattered for his cleverness as
      well as his good looks. Every small attempt at witticism,&mdash;every poor
      joke he could invent, adapt or repeat, was laughed at approvingly in a
      chorus of admiration by smirking human creatures, male and female, who
      bowed and bobbed up and down before the lad like strange dolphins
      disporting themselves on dry land. Whereat he grew to despise the
      dolphins, and no wonder. When he was about seventeen or eighteen he began
      to ask odd questions of one of his preceptors, a learned and ceremonious
      personage who, considering the extent of his certificated wisdom, was yet
      so singularly servile of habit and disposition that he might have won a
      success on the stage as Chief Toady in a burlesque of Court life. He was a
      pale, thin old man, with a wizened face set well back amid wisps of white
      hair, and a scraggy throat which asserted its working muscles visibly
      whenever he spoke, laughed or took food. His way of shaking hands
      expressed his moral flabbiness in the general dampness, looseness and
      limpness of the act,&mdash;not that he often shook hands with his pupil,
      for though that pupil was only a boy made of ordinary flesh and blood like
      other boys, he was nevertheless heir to a Throne, and in strict etiquette
      even friendly liberties were not to be too frequently taken with such an
      Exalted little bit of humanity. The lad himself, however, had a certain
      mischievous delight in making him perform this courtesy, and being young
      and vigorous, would often squeeze the old gentleman's hesitating fingers
      in his strong clasp so energetically as to cause him the severest pain.
      Student of many philosophies as he was, the worthy pedagogue would have
      cried out, or sworn profane oaths in his agony, had it been any other than
      the 'Heir-Apparent' who thus made him wince with torture,&mdash;but as
      matters stood, he merely smiled&mdash;and bore it. The young rascal of a
      prince smiled too,&mdash;taking note of his obsequious hypocrisy, which
      served an inquiring mind with quite as good a field for logical
      speculation as any problem in Euclid. And he went on with his questions,&mdash;questions,
      which if not puzzling, were at least irritating enough to have secured him
      a rap on the knuckles from his tutor's cane, had he been a grocer's lad
      instead of the eldest son of a Royal house.

    <p>
      "Professor," he said on one occasion, "What is man?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Man," replied the professor sedately, "is an intelligent and reasoning
      being, evolved by natural processes of creation into his present condition
      of supremacy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is Supremacy?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The state of being above, or superior to, the rest of the animal
      creation."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And is he so superior?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He is generally so admitted."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is my father a man?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Assuredly! The question is superfluous."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What makes him a King?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Royal birth and the hereditary right to his great position."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then if man is in a condition of supremacy over the rest of creation, a
      king is more than a man if he is allowed to rule men?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sir, pardon me!&mdash;a king is not more than a man, but men choose him
      as their ruler because he is worthy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In what way is he worthy? Simply because he is born as I am, heir to a
      throne?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Precisely."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He might be an idiot or a cripple, a fool or a coward,&mdash;he would
      still be King?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Most indubitably."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So that if he were a madman, he would continue to hold supremacy over a
      nation, though his groom might be sane?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your Royal Highness pursues the question with an unwise flippancy;"&mdash;remonstrated
      the professor with a pained, forced smile. "If an idiot or a madman were
      unfortunately born to a throne, a regency would be appointed to control
      state affairs, but the heir would, in spite of natural incapability,
      remain the lawful king."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A strange sovereignty!" said the young prince carelessly. "And a still
      stranger patience in the people who would tolerate it! Yet over all men,&mdash;kings,
      madmen, and idiots alike,&mdash;there is another ruling force, called
      God?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is a force," admitted the professor dubiously&mdash;"But in the
      present forward state of things it would not be safe to attempt to explain
      the nature of that force, and for the benefit of the illiterate masses we
      call it God. A national worship of something superior to themselves has
      always been proved politic and necessary for the people. I have not at any
      time resolved myself as to why it should be so; but so it is."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then man, despite his 'supremacy' must have something more supreme than
      himself to keep him in order, if it be only a fetish wherewith to tickle
      his imagination?" suggested the prince with a touch of satire,&mdash;"Even
      kings must bow, or pretend to bow, to the King of kings?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sir, you have expressed the fact with felicity;" replied the professor
      gravely&mdash;"His Majesty, your august father, attends public worship
      with punctilious regularity, and you are accustomed to accompany him. It
      is a rule which you will find necessary to keep in practice, as an example
      to your subjects when you are called upon to reign."
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man raised his eyebrows deprecatingly, with a slight ironical
      smile, and dropped the subject. But the learned professor as in duty
      bound, reported the conversation to his pupil's father; with the
      additional observation that he feared, he very humbly and respectfully
      feared, that the developing mind of the prince appeared undesirably
      disposed towards discursive philosophies, which were wholly unnecessary
      for the position he was destined to occupy. Whereupon the King took his
      son to task on the subject with a mingling of kindness and humour.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do not turn philosopher!" he said&mdash;"For philosophy will not so much
      content you with life, as with death! Philosophy will chill your best
      impulses and most generous enthusiasms,&mdash;it will make you
      over-cautious and doubtful of your friends,&mdash;it will cause you to be
      indifferent to women in the plural, but it will hand you over, a weak and
      helpless victim to the <i>one</i> woman,&mdash;when she comes,&mdash;as
      she is bound to come. There is no one so hopelessly insane as a
      philosopher in love! Love women, but not <i>a</i> woman!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "In so doing I should follow the wisest of examples,&mdash;yours, Sir!"
      replied the prince with a familiarity more tender than audacious, for his
      father was a man of fine presence and fascinating manner, and knew well
      the extent of his power to charm and subjugate the fairer sex,&mdash;"But
      I have a fancy that love,&mdash;if it exists anywhere outside the dreams
      of the poets,&mdash;is unknown to kings."
    </p>
    <p>
      The monarch bent his brows frowningly, and his eyes were full of a deep
      and bitter melancholy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You mistake!" he said slowly&mdash;"Love,&mdash;and by that name I mean a
      wholly different thing from Passion,&mdash;comes to kings as to commoners,&mdash;but
      whereas the commoner may win it if he can, the king must reject it. But it
      comes,&mdash;and leaves a blank in the proudest life when it goes!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned away abruptly, and the conversation was not again resumed. But
      when he died, those who prepared his body for burial, found a gold chain
      round his neck, holding the small medallion portrait of a woman, and a
      curl of soft fair hair. Needless to say the portrait was not that of the
      late Queen-Consort, who had died some years before her Royal spouse, nor
      was the hair hers,&mdash;but when they brought the relic to the new King,
      he laid it back with his own hands on his father's lifeless breast, and
      let it go into the grave with him. For, being no longer the crowned
      Servant of the State, he had the right as a mere dead man, to the
      possession of his love-secret.
    </p>
    <p>
      So at least thought his son and successor, who at times was given to
      wondering whether if, like his father, he had such a secret he would be
      able to keep it as closely and as well. He thought not. It would be
      scarcely worth while. It can only be the greatest love that is always
      silent,&mdash;and in the greatest,&mdash;that is, the ideal and
      self-renouncing love,&mdash;he did not believe; though in his own life's
      experience he had been given a proof that such love is possible to women,
      if not to men. When he was about twenty, he had loved, or had imagined he
      loved, a girl,&mdash;a pretty creature, who did not know him as a prince
      at all, but simply as a college student. He used to walk with her hand in
      hand through the fields by the river, and gather wild flowers for her to
      wear in her little white bodice. She had shy soft eyes, and a timid, yet
      trusting look, full of tenderness and pathos. Moved by a romantic sense of
      honour and chivalry, he promised to marry her, and thereupon wrote an
      impulsive letter to his father informing him of his intention. Of course
      he was summoned home from college at once,&mdash;he was reminded of his
      high destiny&mdash;of the Throne that would be his if he lived to occupy
      it,&mdash;of the great and serious responsibilities awaiting him,&mdash;and
      of how impossible it was that the Heir-Apparent to the Crown should marry
      a commoner.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why not?" he cried passionately&mdash;"If she be good and true she is as
      fit to be a queen as any woman royally born! She is a queen already in her
      own right!"
    </p>
    <p>
      But while he was being argued with and controlled by all the authorities
      concerned in king's business, his little sweetheart herself put an end to
      the matter. Her parents told her all unpreparedly, and with no doubt
      unnecessary harshness, the real position of the college lad with whom she
      had wandered in the fields so confidingly; and in the bewilderment of her
      poor little broken heart and puzzled brain, she gave herself to the river
      by whose flowering banks she had sworn her maiden vows,&mdash;though she
      knew it not,&mdash;to her future King; and so, drowning her life and love
      together, made a piteous exit from all difficulty. Before she went forth
      to die, she wrote a farewell to her Royal lover, posting the letter
      herself on her way to the river, and, by the merest chance he received it
      without a spy's intervention. It was but one line, scrawled in a round
      youthful hand, and blotted with many tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sir&mdash;my love!&mdash;forgive me!"
    </p>
    <p>
      It would be unwise to say what that little scrap of ill-formed writing
      cost the heir to a throne when he heard how she had died,&mdash;or how he
      raged and swore and wept. It was the first Wrong forced on him as Right,
      by the laws of the realm; and he was young and generous and honest, and
      not hardened to those laws then. Their iniquity and godlessness appeared
      to him in plain ugly colours undisguised. Since that time he had perforce
      fallen into the habit and routine of his predecessors, though he was not
      altogether so 'constitutional' a sovereign as his father had been. He had
      something of the spirit of one who had occupied his throne five hundred
      years before him; when strength and valour and wit and boldness, gave more
      kings to the world than came by heritage. He did unconventional things now
      and then; to the grief of flunkeys, and the alarm of Court parasites. But
      his kingdom was of the South, where hot blood is recognized and excused,
      and fiery temper more admired than censured, and where,&mdash;so far as
      social matters went,&mdash;his word, whether kind, cold, or capricious,
      was sufficient to lead in any direction that large flock of the silly
      sheep of fashion who only exist to eat, and to be eaten. Sometimes he
      longed to throw himself back into bygone centuries and stand as his
      earliest ancestor stood, sword in hand, on a height overlooking the
      battle-field, watching the swaying rush of combat,&mdash;the glitter of
      spears and axes&mdash;the sharp flight of arrows&mdash;the tossing
      banners, the grinding chariots, the flying dust and carnage of men! There
      was something to fight for in those days,&mdash;there was no careful
      binding up of wounds,&mdash;no provision for the sick or the mutilated,&mdash;nothing,
      nothing, but 'Victory or Death!' How much grander, how much finer the old
      fierce ways of war than now, when any soldier wounded, may write the
      details of his bayonet-scratch or bullet-hole to the cheap press, and the
      surgeon prys about with Rontgen-ray paraphernalia and scalpel, to discover
      how much or how little escape from dissolution a man's soul has had in the
      shock of contest with his foe! Of a truth these are paltry days!&mdash;and
      paltry days breed paltry men. Afraid of sickness, afraid of death, afraid
      of poverty, afraid of offences, afraid to think, afraid to speak, Man in
      the present era of his boasted 'progress' resembles nothing so much as a
      whipped child,&mdash;cowering under the outstretched arm of Heaven and
      waiting in whimpering terror for the next fall of the scourge. And it is
      on this point especially, that the monarch who takes part in this
      unhesitating chronicle of certain thoughts and movements hidden out of
      sight,&mdash;yet deeply felt in the under-silences of the time,&mdash;may
      claim to be unconventional;&mdash;he was afraid of nothing,&mdash;not even
      of himself as King!

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II. &mdash; MAJESTY CONSIDERS AND RESOLVES
    </h2>
    <p>
      The little episode of his first love, combined with his ungovernable fury
      and despair at its tragic conclusion, had of course the natural result
      common in such a case, to the fate of all who are destined to occupy
      thrones. A marriage was 'arranged' for him; and pressing reasons of state
      were urged for the quick enforcement and carrying out of the
      'arrangement.' The daughter of a neighbouring potentate was elected to the
      honour of his alliance,&mdash;a beautiful girl with a pale, cold clear-cut
      face and brilliant eyes, whose smile penetrated the soul with an icy
      chill, and whose very movement, noiseless and graceful as it was, reminded
      one irresistibly of slowly drifting snow. She was attended to the altar,
      as he was, by all the ministers and plenipotentiaries of state that could
      possibly be gathered together from the four quarters of the globe as
      witnesses to the immolation of two young human lives on the grim
      sacrificial stone of a Dynasty; and both prince and princess accepted
      their fate with mutually silent and civil resignation. Their portraits,
      set facing each other with a silly smile, or taken in a linked arm-in-arm
      attitude against a palatial canvas background, appeared in every paper
      published throughout the world, and every scribbler on the Press took
      special pains to inform the easily deluded public that the Royal union
      thus consummated was 'a romantic love-match.' For the People still have
      heart and conscience,&mdash;the People, taken in the rough lump of
      humanity, still believe in love, in faith, in the dear sweetness of home
      affections. The politicians who make capital out of popular emotion, know
      this well enough,&mdash;and are careful to play the tune of their own
      personal interest upon the gamut of National Sentiment in every stump
      oration. For how terrible it would be if the People of any land learned to
      judge their preachers and teachers by the lines of fact alone! Inasmuch as
      fact would convincingly prove to them that their leaders prospered and
      grew rich, while they stayed poor; and they might take to puzzling out
      reasons for this inadequacy which would inevitably cause trouble. For
      this, and divers other motives politic, the rosy veil of sentiment is
      always delicately flung more or less over every new move on the national
      debating-ground,&mdash;and whether marriageable princes and princesses
      love or loathe each other, still, when they come to wed, the words
      'romantic love-match' must be thrown in by an obliging Press in order to
      satisfy the tender scruples of a people who would certainly not abide the
      thought of a Royal marriage contracted in mutual aversion. Thus much
      soundness and right principle there is at least, in what some superfine
      persons call the 'common' folk,&mdash;the folk whose innermost sense of
      truth and straightforwardness, not even the proudest statesman dare
      outrage.
    </p>
    <p>
      But with what unuttered and unutterable scorn the youthful victims of the
      Royal pairing accepted the newspaper-assurances of the devoted tenderness
      they entertained for each other! With what wearied impatience both prince
      and princess received the 'Wedding Odes' and 'Epithalamiums,' written by
      first-class and no-class versifiers for the occasion! What shoals of these
      were cast aside unread, to occupy the darkest dingiest corner of one of
      the Royal 'refuse' libraries! The writers of such things expected great
      honours, no doubt, each and every man-jack of them,&mdash;but apart from
      the fact that the greatest literature has always lived without any
      official recognition or endowment from kings,&mdash;being in itself the
      supremest sovereignty,&mdash;poets and rhymesters alike never seem to
      realize that no one is, or can be, so sickened by an 'Ode' as the man or
      woman to whom it is written!
    </p>
    <p>
      The brilliant marriage ceremony concluded, the august bride and bridegroom
      took their departure, amid frantically cheering crowds, for a stately
      castle standing high among the mountains, a truly magnificent pile, which
      had been placed at their disposal for the 'honeymoon' by one of the
      wealthiest of the King's subjects,&mdash;and there, as soon as equerries,
      grooms-in-waiting, flunkeys, and every other sort of indoor and outdoor
      retainer would consent to leave them alone together, the Royal wife came
      to her Royal husband, and asked to be allowed to speak a few words on the
      subject of their marriage, 'for the first and last time,' said she, with a
      straight glance from the cold moonlight mystery of her eyes. Beautiful at
      all times, her beauty was doubly enhanced by the regal attitude and
      expression she unconsciously assumed as she made the request, and the
      prince, critically studying her form and features, could not but regard
      himself as in some respects rather particularly favoured by the political
      and social machinery which had succeeded in persuading so fair a creature
      to resign herself to the doubtful destiny of a throne. She had laid aside
      her magnificent bridal-robes of ivory satin and cloth-of-gold,&mdash;and
      appeared before him in loose draperies of floating white, with her rich
      hair unbound and rippling to her knees.
    </p>
    <p>
      "May I speak?" she murmured, and her voice trembled.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Most assuredly!"&mdash;he replied, half smiling&mdash;"You do me too much
      honour by requesting the permission!"
    </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke, he bowed profoundly, but she, raising her eyes, fixed them
      full upon him with a strange look of mingled pride and pain.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do not," she said, "let us play at formalities! Let us be honest with
      each other for to-night at least! All our life together must from
      henceforth be more or less of a masquerade, but let us for to-night be as
      true man and true woman, and frankly face the position into which we have
      been thrust, not by ourselves, but by others."
    </p>
    <p>
      Profoundly astonished, the prince was silent. He had not thought this girl
      of nineteen possessed any force of character or any intellectual power of
      reasoning. He had judged her as no doubt glad to become a great princess
      and a possible future queen, and he had not given her credit for any finer
      or higher feeling.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You know,"&mdash;she continued&mdash;"you must surely know&mdash;" here,
      despite the strong restraint she put upon herself, her voice broke, and
      her slight figure swayed in its white draperies as if about to fall. She
      looked at him with a sense of rising tears in her throat,&mdash;tears of
      which she was ashamed,&mdash;for she was full of a passionate emotion too
      strong for weeping&mdash;a contempt of herself and of him, too great for
      mere clamour. Was he so much of a man in the slow thick density of his
      brain she thought, as to have no instinctive perception of her utter
      misery? He hastened to her and tried to take her hands, but she drew
      herself away from him and sank down in a chair as if exhausted.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are tired!" he said kindly&mdash;"The tedious ceremonial&mdash;the
      still more tedious congratulations,&mdash;and the fatiguing journey from
      the capital to this place have been too much for your strength. You must
      rest!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is not that!"&mdash;she answered&mdash;"not that! I am not tired,&mdash;but&mdash;but&mdash;I
      cannot say my prayers tonight till you know my whole heart!"
    </p>
    <p>
      A curious reverence and pity moved him. All day long he had been in a
      state of resentful irritation,&mdash;he had loathed himself for having
      consented to marry this girl without loving her,&mdash;he had branded
      himself inwardly as a liar and hypocrite when he had sworn his marriage
      vows 'before God,' whereas if he truly believed in God, such vows taken
      untruthfully were mere blasphemy;&mdash;and now she herself, a young thing
      tenderly brought up like a tropical flower in the enervating hot-house
      atmosphere of Court life, yet had such a pure, deep consciousness of God
      in her, that she actually could not pray with the slightest blur of a
      secret on her soul! He waited wonderingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have plighted my faith to you before God's altar to-day," she said,
      speaking more steadily,&mdash;"because after long and earnest thought, I
      saw that there was no other way of satisfying the two nations to which we
      belong, and cementing the friendly relations between them. There is no
      woman of Royal birth,&mdash;so it has been pointed out to me&mdash;who is
      so suitable, from a political point of view, to be your wife as I. It is
      for the sake of your Throne and country that you must marry&mdash;and I
      ask God to forgive me if I have done wrong in His sight by wedding you
      simply for duty's sake. My father, your father, and all who are connected
      with our two families desire our union, and have assured me that, it is
      right and good for me to give up my life to yours. All women's lives must
      be martyred to the laws made by men,&mdash;or so it seems to me,&mdash;I
      cannot expect to escape from the general doom apportioned to my sex. I
      therefore accept the destiny which transfers me to you as a piece of human
      property for possession and command,&mdash;I accept it freely, but I will
      not say gladly, because that would not be true. For I do not love you,&mdash;I
      cannot love you! I want you to know that, and to feel it, that you may not
      ask from me what I cannot give."
    </p>
    <p>
      There were no tears in her eyes; she looked at him straightly and
      steadfastly. He, in his turn, met her gaze fully,&mdash;his face had paled
      a little, and a shadow of pained regret and commiseration darkened his
      handsome features.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You love someone else?" he asked, softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      She rose from her chair and confronted him, a glow of passionate pride
      flushing her cheeks and brow.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No!" she said&mdash;"I would not be a traitor to you in so much as a
      thought! Had I loved anyone else I would never have married you,&mdash;no!&mdash;though
      you had been ten times a prince and king! No! You do not understand. I
      come to you heartwhole and passionless, without a single love-word
      chronicled in my girlhood's history, or a single incident you may not
      know. I have never loved any man, because from my very childhood I have
      hated and feared all men! I loathe their presence&mdash;their looks&mdash;their
      voices&mdash;their manners,&mdash;if one should touch my hand in ordinary
      courtesy, my instincts are offended and revolted, and the sense of outrage
      remains with me for days. My mother knows of this, and says I am
      'unnatural,'&mdash;it may be so. But unnatural or not, it is the truth;
      judge therefore the extent of the sacrifice I make to God and our two
      countries in giving myself to you!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The prince stood amazed and confounded. Did she rave? Was she mad? He
      studied her with a curious, half-doubting scrutiny, and noted the
      composure of her attitude, the cold serenity of her expression,&mdash;there
      was evidently no hysteria, no sur-excitation of nerves about this calm
      statuesque beauty which in every line and curve of loveliness silently
      mutinied against him, and despised him. Puzzled, yet fascinated, he sought
      in his mind for some clue to her meaning.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There are women" she went on&mdash;"to whom love, or what is called love,
      is necessary,&mdash;for whom marriage is the utmost good of existence. I
      am not one of these. Had I my own choice I would live my life away from
      all men,&mdash;I would let nothing of myself be theirs to claim,&mdash;I
      would give all I am and all I have to God, who made me what I am. For
      truly and honestly, without any affectation at all, I look upon marriage,
      not as an honour, but a degradation!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Had she been less in earnest, he might have smiled at this, but her
      beauty, intensified as it was by the fervour of her feeling, seemed
      transfigured into something quite supernatural which for the moment
      dazzled him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Am I to understand&mdash;" he began.
    </p>
    <p>
      She interrupted him by a swift gesture, while the rich colour swept over
      her face in a warm wave.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Understand nothing"&mdash;she said,&mdash;"but this&mdash;that I do not
      love you, because I can love no man! For the rest I am your wife; and as
      your wife I give myself to you and your nation wholly and in all things&mdash;save
      love!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He advanced and took her hands in his.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This is a strange bargain!" he said, and gently kissed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She answered nothing,&mdash;only a faint shiver trembled through her as
      she endured the caress. For a moment or two he surveyed her in silence,&mdash;it
      was a singular and novel experience for him, as a future king, to be the
      lawful possessor of a woman's beauty, and yet with all his sovereignty to
      be unable to waken one thrill of tenderness in the frozen soul imprisoned
      in such exquisite flesh and blood. He was inclined to disbelieve her
      assertions,&mdash;surely he thought, there must be emotion, feeling,
      passion in this fair creature, who, though she seemed a goddess newly
      descended from inaccessible heights of heaven was still <i>only</i> a
      woman? And upon the whole he was not ill-pleased with the curious
      revelation she had made of herself. He preferred the coldness of women to
      their volcanic eruptions, and would take more pains to melt the snow of
      reserve than to add fuel to the flame of ardour.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have been very frank with me," he said at last, after a pause, as he
      loosened her hands and moved a little apart from her&mdash;"And whether
      your physical and mental hatred of my sex is a defect in your nature, or
      an exceptional virtue, I shall not quarrel with it. I am myself not
      without faults; and the chiefest of these is one most common to all men. I
      desire what I may not have, and covet what I do not possess. So! We
      understand each other!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She raised her eyes&mdash;those beautiful deep eyes with the moonlight
      glamour in them,&mdash;and for an instant the shining Soul of her, pure
      and fearless, seemed to spring up and challenge to spiritual combat him
      who was now her body's master. Then, bending her head with a graceful yet
      proud submission, she retired.
    </p>
    <p>
      From that time forth she never again spoke on this, or any other subject
      of an intimate or personal nature, with her Royal spouse. Cold as an
      iceberg, pure as a diamond, she accepted both wifehood and motherhood as
      martyrdom, with an evident contempt for its humiliation, and without one
      touch of love for either husband or children. She bore three sons, of whom
      the eldest, and heir to the throne was, at the time this history begins,
      just twenty. The passing of the years had left scarcely a trace upon her
      beauty, save to increase it from the sparkling luminance of a star to the
      glory of a full-orbed moon of loveliness,&mdash;and she had easily won a
      triumph over all the other women around her, in the power she possessed to
      command and retain the admiration of men. She was one of those brilliant
      creatures who, like the Egyptian Cleopatra, never grow old,&mdash;for she
      was utterly exempt from the wasting of the nerves through emotion. Her
      eyes were always bright and clear; her skin dazzling in its whiteness,
      save where the equably flowing blood flushed it with tenderest rose,&mdash;her
      figure remained svelte, lithe and graceful in all its outlines. Finely
      strung, yet strong as steel in her temperament, all thoughts, feelings and
      events seemed to sweep over her without affecting or disturbing her mind's
      calm equipoise. She lived her life with extreme simplicity, regularity,
      and directness, thus driving to despair all would-be scandal-mongers; and
      though many gifted and famous men fell madly in love with their great
      princess, and often, in the extremity of a passion which amounted to
      disloyalty, slew themselves for her sake, she remained unmoved and
      pitiless.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her husband occasionally felt some compassion for the desperate fellows
      who thus immolated themselves on the High Altar of her perfections, though
      it must be admitted that he received the news of their deaths with
      tolerable equanimity, knowing them to have been fools, and as such, better
      out of the world than in it. During the first two or three years of his
      marriage he had himself been somewhat of their disposition, and as mere
      man, had tried by every means in his power to win the affection of his
      beautiful spouse, and to melt the icy barrier which she, despite their
      relations with each other, had resolutely kept up between herself and him.
      He had made the attempt, not because he actually loved her, but simply
      because he desired the satisfaction of conquest. Finding the task
      hopeless, he resigned himself to his fate, and accepted her at the costly
      valuation she set upon herself; though for pastime he would often pay
      court to certain ladies of easy virtue, with the vague idea that perhaps
      the spirit of jealousy might enter that cold shrine of womanhood where no
      other demon could force admission, and wake up the passions slumbering
      within. But she appeared not to be at all aware of his many and open
      gallantries; and only at stray moments, when her frosty flashing glance
      fell upon him engaged in some casual flirtation, would a sudden smarting
      sense of injury make him conscious of her contempt.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he could reasonably find no fault with her, save the fault of being
      faultless. She was a perfect hostess, and fulfilled all the duties of her
      exalted position with admirable tact and foresight,&mdash;she was ever
      busy in the performance of good and charitable deeds,&mdash;she was an
      excellent mother, and took the utmost personal care that her sons should
      be healthily nurtured and well brought up,&mdash;she never interfered in
      any matter of state or ceremony,&mdash;she simply seemed to move as a star
      moves, shining over the earth but having no part in it. Irresponsive as
      she was, she nevertheless compelled admiration,&mdash;her husband himself
      admired her, but only as he would have admired a statue or a painting. For
      his was an impulsive and generous nature, and his marriage had kept his
      heart empty of the warmth of love, and his home devoid of the light of
      sympathy. Even his children had been born more as the sons of the nation
      than his own,&mdash;he was not conscious of any very great affection for
      them, or interest in their lives. And he had sought to kindle at many
      strange fires the heavenly love-beacon which should have flamed its living
      glory into his days; so it had naturally chanced that he had spent by far
      the larger portion of his time on the persuasion of mere Whim,&mdash;and
      as vastly inferior women to his wife had made him spend it.
    </p>
    <p>
      But at this particular juncture, when the curtain is drawn up on certain
      scenes and incidents in his life-drama, a change had been effected in his
      opinions and surroundings. For eighteen years after his marriage, he had
      lived on the first step of the Throne as its next heir; and when he passed
      that step and ascended the Throne itself, he seemed to have crossed a vast
      abyss of distance between the Old and the New. Behind him the Past rolled
      away like a cloud vanishing, to be seen no more,&mdash;before him arose
      the dim vista of wavering and uncertain shadows, which no matter how they
      shifted and changed,&mdash;no matter how many flashes of sunshine
      flickered through them,&mdash;were bound to close in the thick gloom of
      the inevitable end,&mdash;Death. This is what he was chiefly thinking of,
      seated alone in his garden-pavilion facing the sea on that brilliant
      southern summer morning,&mdash;this,&mdash;and with the thought came many
      others no less sad and dubious,&mdash;such as whether for example, his
      eldest son might not already be eager for the crown?&mdash;whether even
      now, though he had only reigned three years, his people were not more or
      less dissatisfied under his rule?
    </p>
    <p>
      His father, the late King, had died suddenly,&mdash;so suddenly that there
      was neither help nor hope for him among the hastily summoned physicians.
      Stricken numb and speechless, he kept his anguished eyes fixed to the last
      upon his son, as one who should say&mdash;"Alas, and to thee also, falls
      this curse of a Crown!" Once dead, he was soon forgotten,&mdash;the pomp
      of the Royal obsequies merely made a gala-day for the light-hearted
      Southern populace, who hailed the accession of their new King with as much
      gladness as a child, who, having broken one doll, straightway secures
      another as good, if not better. As Heir-Apparent the succeeding sovereign
      had won great popularity, and was much more generally beloved than his
      father had been,&mdash;so that it was on an extra high wave of jubilation
      and acclamation that he and his beautiful consort were borne to the
      Throne.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three years had passed since then; and so far his reign had been
      untroubled by much difficulty. Difficulty there was, but he was kept in
      ignorance of it,&mdash;troubles were brooding, but he was not informed of
      them. Things likely to be disagreeable were not conveyed to his ears,&mdash;and
      matters which, had he been allowed to examine into them, might have
      aroused his indignation and interference, were diplomatically hushed up.
      He was known to possess much more than the limited intelligence usually
      apportioned to kings; and certainly, as his tutor had said of him in his
      youth, he was dangerously "disposed towards discursive philosophies." He
      was likewise accredited with a conscience, which many diplomats consider
      to be a wholly undesirable ingredient in the moral composition of a
      reigning monarch. Therefore, those who move a king, as in the game of
      chess, one square at a time and no more,&mdash;were particularly cautious
      as to the 'way' in which they moved him. He had shown himself difficult to
      manage once or twice; and interested persons could not pursue their usual
      course of self-aggrandisement with him, as he was not susceptible to
      flattery. He had a way of asking straight questions, and what was still
      worse, expecting straight answers, such as politicians never give.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless he had, up to the present, ruled his conduct very much on the
      lines laid down by his predecessors, and during his brief reign had been
      more or less content to passively act in all things as his ministers
      advised. He had bestowed honours on fools because his ministers considered
      it politic,&mdash;he had given his formal consent to the imposition of
      certain taxes on his people, because his ministers had judged such taxes
      necessary,&mdash;in fact he had done everything he was expected to do, and
      nothing that he was not expected to do. He had not taken any close
      personal thought as to whether such and such a political movement was, or
      was not, welcome to the spirit of the nation, nor had he weighed
      intimately in his own mind the various private interests of the members of
      his Government, in passing, or moving the rejection of, any important
      measure affecting the well-being of the community at large. And he had
      lately,&mdash;perhaps through the objectionable 'discursive philosophies'
      before mentioned,&mdash;come to consider himself somewhat of a stuffed
      Dummy or figure-head; and to wonder what would be the result, if with
      caution and prudence, he were to act more on his own initiative, and speak
      as he often thought it would be wise and well to speak? He was but
      forty-five years old,&mdash;in the prime of life, in the plenitude of
      health and mental vigour,&mdash;was he to pass the rest of his days
      guarded by detectives, flunkeys and physicians, with never an independent
      word or action throughout his whole career to mark him Man as well as
      Monarch? Nay, surely that would be an insult to the God who made him! But
      the question which arose in his mind and perplexed him was, How to begin?
      How, after passive obedience, to commence resistance? How to break through
      the miserable conventionalism, the sordid commonplace of a king's
      surroundings? For it is only in medieval fairy-tales that kings are
      permitted to be kingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet, despite custom and usage, he was determined to make a new departure
      in the annals of modern sovereignty. Three years of continuous slavery on
      the treadmill of the Throne had been sufficient to make him thirst for
      freedom,&mdash;freedom of speech,&mdash;freedom of action. He had tacitly
      submitted to a certain ministry because he had been assured that the said
      ministry was popular,&mdash;but latterly, rumours of discontent and
      grievance had reached him,&mdash;albeit indistinctly and incoherently,&mdash;and
      he began to be doubtful as to whether it might not be the Press which
      supported the existing state of policy, rather than the People. The Press!
      He began to consider of what material this great power in his country was
      composed. Originally, the Press in all countries, was intended to be the
      most magnificent institution of the civilized world,&mdash;the voice of
      truth, of liberty, of justice&mdash;a voice which in its clamant
      utterances could neither be bribed nor biassed to cry out false news.
      Originally, such was meant to be its mission;&mdash;but nowadays, what, in
      all honesty and frankness, is the Press? What was it, for example, to this
      king, who from personal knowledge, was able to practically estimate and
      enumerate the forces which controlled it thus:&mdash;Six, or at the most a
      dozen men, the proprietors and editors of different newspapers sold in
      cheap millions to the people. Most of these newspapers were formed into
      'companies'; and the managers issued 'shares' in the fashion of tea
      merchants and grocers. False news, if of a duly sensational character,
      would sometimes send up the shares in the market,&mdash;true information
      would equally, on occasion, send them down. These premises granted, might
      it not follow that for newspaper speculators, the False would often prove
      more lucrative than the True? And, concerning the persons who wrote for
      these newspapers,&mdash;of what calling and election were they? Male and
      female, young and old, they were generally of a semi-educated class
      lacking all distinctive ability,&mdash;men and women who were, on an
      average, desperately poor, and desperately dissatisfied. To earn daily
      bread they naturally had to please the editors set in authority over them;
      hence their expressed views and opinions on any subject could only be
      counted as <i>nil</i>, being written, not independently, but under the
      absolute control of their employers. Thus meditating, the King summed up
      the total of his own mental argument, and found that the vast sounding
      'power of the Press' so far as his own dominion was concerned, resolved
      itself into the mere trade monopoly of the aforesaid leading dozen men.
      What he now proposed to himself to discover among other things, was,&mdash;how
      far and how truly these dozen tradesmen voiced the mind of the People over
      whom he was elected to reign? Here was a problem, and one not easy to
      solve. But what was very plain and paramount to his mind was this,&mdash;that
      he was thoroughly sick and tired of being no more than a 'social' figure
      in the world's affairs. It was an effeminate part to play. It was time, he
      considered, that he should intelligently try his own strength, and test
      the nation's quality.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If there is corruption in the state," he said to himself, "I will find
      its centre! If I am fooled by my advisers then I will be fooled no longer.
      With whatsoever brain and heart and reason and understanding the Fates
      have endowed me, I will study the ways, the movements, the desires of my
      people, and prove myself their friend, as well as their king. Suppose they
      misunderstand me?&mdash;What matter!&mdash;Let the nation rise against me
      an' it will, so that I may, before I die, prove myself worthy of the mere
      gift of manhood! To-day"&mdash;and, rising from his chair, he advanced a
      step or two and faced the sea and sky with an unconscious gesture of
      invocation; "To-day shall be the first day of my real monarchy! To-day I
      begin to reign! The past is past,&mdash;for eighteen long years as prince
      and heir to the throne I trifled away my time among the follies of the
      hour, and laughed at the easy purchase I could make of the assumed
      'honour' of men and women; and I enjoyed the liberty and license of my
      position. Since then, for three years I have been the prisoner of my
      Parliament,&mdash;but now&mdash;now, and for the rest of the time granted
      to me on earth, I will live my life in the belief that its riddle must
      surely meet with God's own explanation. To me it has become evident that
      the laws of Nature make for Truth and Justice; while the laws of man are
      framed on deception and injustice. The two sets of laws contend one
      against the other, and the finite, after foolish and vain struggle,
      succumbs to the infinite,&mdash;better therefore, to begin with the
      infinite Order than strive with the finite Chaos! I, a mere earthly
      sovereign, rank myself on the side of the Infinite,&mdash;and will work
      for Truth and Justice with the revolving of Its giant wheel! My people
      have seen me crowned,&mdash;but my real Coronation is to-day&mdash;when I
      crown myself with my own resolve!"
    </p>
    <p>
      His eyes flashed in the sunshine;&mdash;a rose shook its pink petals on
      the ground at his feet. In one of the many pleasure-boats skimming across
      the sea, a man was singing; and the words he sang floated distinctly along
      on the landward wind.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  "Let me be thine, O love,
  But for an hour! I yield my heart and soul
  Into thy power,&mdash;Let me be thine, O Love of mine,
  But for an hour!"
</pre>
    <p>
      The King listened, and a faint shadow darkened the proud light on his
      face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'But for an hour!'" he said half aloud&mdash;"Yes,&mdash;it would be
      enough! No woman's love lasts longer!"

      CHAPTER III. &mdash; A NATION OR A CHURCH?
    </h2>
    <p>
      An approaching step echoing on the marble terrace warned him that he was
      no longer alone. He reseated himself at his writing-table, and feigned to
      be deeply engrossed in perusing various documents, but a ready smile
      greeted the intruder as soon as he perceived who it was,&mdash;one Sir
      Roger de Launay, his favourite equerry and intimate personal friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Time's up, is it, Roger?" he queried lightly,&mdash;then as the equerry
      bowed in respectful silence&mdash;"And yet I have scarcely glanced at
      these papers! All the same, I have not been idle&mdash;I have been
      thinking."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Roger de Launay, a tall handsome man, with an indefinable air of
      mingled good-nature and lassitude about him which suggested the
      possibility of his politely urging even Death itself not to be so much of
      a bore about its business, smiled doubtfully. "Is it a wise procedure,
      Sir?" he enquired&mdash;"Conducive to comfort I mean?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The King laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No&mdash;I cannot say that it is! But thought is a tonic which sometimes
      restores a man's enfeebled self-respect. I was beginning to lose that
      particular condition of health and sanity, Roger!&mdash;my self-respect
      was becoming a flaccid muscle&mdash;a withering nerve;&mdash;but a little
      thought-exercise has convinced me that my mental sinews are yet on the
      whole strong!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Roger offered no reply. His eyes expressed a certain languid
      wonderment; but duty being paramount with him, and his immediate errand
      being to remind his sovereign of an appointment then about due, he began
      to collect the writing materials scattered about on the table and put them
      together for convenient removal. The smile on the King's face deepened as
      he watched him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You do not answer me, De Launay,"&mdash;he resumed, "You think perhaps
      that I am talking in parables, and that my mind has been persuaded into a
      metaphysical and rambling condition by an hour's contemplation of the
      sunlight on the sea! But come now!&mdash;have you not yourself felt a
      longing to break loose from the trammels of conventional routine,&mdash;to
      be set free from the slavery of answering another's beck and call,&mdash;to
      be something more than my attendant and friend&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sir, more than your friend I have never desired to be!" said Sir Roger,
      simply.
    </p>
    <p>
      The King extended his hand with impulsive quickness, and Sir Roger as he
      clasped it, bent low and touched it with his lips. There was no
      parasitical homage in the act, for De Launay loved his sovereign with a
      love little known at courts; loyally, faithfully, and without a particle
      of self-seeking. He had long recognized the nobility, truth and courage
      which graced and tempered the disposition of the master he served, and
      knew him to be one, if not the only, monarch in the world likely to confer
      some lasting benefit on his people by his reign.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I tell you," pursued the King, "that there is something in the mortal
      composition of every man which is beyond mortality, something which
      clamours to be heard, and seen, and proved. We may call it conscience,
      intellect, spirit or soul, and attribute its existence, to God, as a spark
      of the Divine Essence, but whatever it is, it is in every one of us; and
      there comes a moment in life when it must flame out, or be quenched
      forever. That moment has come to me, Roger,&mdash;that something in me
      must have its way!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your Majesty no doubt desires the impossible!"&mdash;said Sir Roger with
      a smile, "All men do,&mdash;even kings!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Even kings!'" echoed the monarch&mdash;"You may well say 'even' kings!
      What are kings? Simply the most wronged and miserable men on earth! I do
      not myself put in a special claim for pity. My realm is small, and my
      people are, for aught I can learn or am told of them, contented. But other
      sovereigns who are my friends and neighbours, live, as it were, under the
      dagger's point,&mdash;with dynamite at their feet and pistols at their
      heads,&mdash;all for no fault of their own, but for the faults of a system
      which they did not formulate. Conspirators on the threshold&mdash;poison
      in the air,&mdash;as in Russia, for example!&mdash;where is the joy or the
      pride of being a King nowadays?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Talking of poison," said Sir Roger blandly, as he placed the last
      document of those he had collected, neatly in a leather case and strapped
      it&mdash;"Your Majesty may perhaps feel inclined to defer giving the
      promised audience to Monsignor Del Fords of the Society of Jesus?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "By Heaven, I had forgotten him!" and the King rose. "This is what you
      came to remind me of, Roger? He is here?"
    </p>
    <p>
      De Launay bowed an assent.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well! We have kept a messenger of Mother Church waiting our pleasure,&mdash;and
      not for the first time in the annals of history! But why do you associate
      his name with poison?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Really, Sir, the connection is inexplicable,&mdash;unless it be the
      memory of a religious lesson-book given to me in my childhood. It was an
      illustrated treasure, and one picture showed me the Almighty in the
      character of an old gentleman seated placidly on a cloud, smiling;&mdash;while
      on the earth below, a priest, exactly resembling this Del Fortis, poured a
      spoonful of something,&mdash;poison&mdash;or it might have been boiling
      lead&mdash;down the throat of a heretic. I remember it impressed me very
      much with the goodness of God."
    </p>
    <p>
      He maintained a whimsical gravity as he spoke, and the King laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "De Launay, you are incorrigible! Come!&mdash;we will go within and see
      this Del Fortis, and you shall remain present during the audience. That
      will give you a chance to improve your present impression of him. I
      understand he is a very brilliant and leading member of his Order,&mdash;likely
      to be the next Vicar-General. I know his errand,&mdash;the papers
      concerning his business are there&mdash;," and he waved his hand towards
      the leather case Sir Roger had just fastened&mdash;"Bring them with you!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Roger obeyed, and the King, stepping forth from the pavilion, walked
      slowly along the terrace, watching the sparkling sea, the flowering
      orange-trees lifting their slender tufts of exquisitely scented bloom
      against the clear blue of the sky, the birds skimming lightly from point
      to point of foliage, and the white-sailed yachts dipping gracefully as the
      ocean rose and fell with every wild sweet breath of the scented wind.
      Pausing a moment, he presently took out a field-glass and looked through
      it at one of the finest and fairest of these pleasure-vessels, which, as
      he surveyed it, suddenly swung round, and began to scud away westward.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Prince is on board?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, Sir," replied De Launay&mdash;"His Royal Highness intends sailing as
      far as The Islands, and remaining there till sunset."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Alone, as usual?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "As usual, Sir, alone, save for his captain and crew."
    </p>
    <p>
      The King walked on in silence for a minute. Then he paused abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do not like it, De Launay!"&mdash;he said decisively&mdash;"I do not
      like his abnormal love of solitude. Books are all very well&mdash;poetry
      is in its way excellent,&mdash;music, as we are told 'hath charms'&mdash;but
      the boy broods too much, and stays away too much from Court. What woman
      attracts him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Roger's eyes opened wide as the King turned suddenly round upon him
      with this question.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Woman, Sir? I know of none. The Prince is but twenty&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "At twenty," said the King,&mdash;"boys love&mdash;the wrong girl. At
      thirty they marry&mdash;the wrong woman. At forty they meet the only true
      and fitting soul's companion,&mdash;and cry for the moon till the end! My
      son is in the first stage, or I am much mistaken,&mdash;he loves&mdash;the
      wrong girl!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He walked on,&mdash;and De Launay followed, with a vague sense of
      amusement and disquietude in his mind. What had come to his Royal master,
      he wondered? His ordinary manner had changed somewhat,&mdash;he spoke with
      less than the customary formality, and there was an expression of freedom
      and authority, combined with a touch of defiance in his face, that was
      altogether new to the observation of the faithful equerry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arrived at the palace, and passing through one of the long and spacious
      painted corridors, lit by richly coloured mullioned windows from end to
      end, the King came face to face with a lady-in-waiting carrying a large
      cluster of Madonna lilies. She drew aside, with a deep reverence, to allow
      him to pass; but he stopped a moment, looking at the great gorgeous white
      flowers faint with fragrance, and at the slight retiring figure of the
      woman who held them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are these for the chapel, Madame?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, Sir! For the Queen."
    </p>
    <p>
      'For the Queen!' A quick sigh escaped him. He still stood, caught by a
      sudden abstraction, looking at the dazzling whiteness of the snowy blooms,
      and thinking how fittingly they would companion his beautiful, cold, pure
      Queen Consort, who had never from her marriage day uttered a word of love
      to him, or given him a glance of tenderness. Their rich odours crept into
      his warm blood, and the bitter old sense of unfulfilled longing, longing
      for affection, for comprehension, for all that he had not possessed in his
      otherwise brilliant life, vexed and sickened him. He turned away abruptly,
      and the lady-in-waiting, having curtsied once more profoundly, passed on
      with her glistening sheaf of bloom and disappeared vision-like in a gleam
      of azure light falling through one of the further and higher casements.
      The King watched her disappear, the meditative line of sadness still
      puckering his brow, then, followed by his equerry, he entered a small
      private audience chamber, where Sir Roger de Launay notified an attendant
      gentleman usher that his Majesty was ready to receive Monsignor Del
      Fortis.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the brief interval occupied in waiting for his visitor's approach,
      the King selected certain papers from those which Sir Roger had brought
      from the garden pavilion and placed them in order on the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      "For the past six months," he said "I have had this Jesuit's name before
      me, and have been in twenty minds a month about granting or refusing what
      his Society demands. The matter has been discussed in the Press, too, with
      the usual pros and cons of hesitation, but it is the People I am thinking
      of, the People! and I am just now in the humour to satisfy a Nation rather
      than a Church!"
    </p>
    <p>
      De Launay said nothing. His opinion was not asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is a case in which the temporal overbalances the spiritual," continued
      the King&mdash;"Which plainly proves that the spiritual must be lacking in
      some essential point somewhere. For if the spiritual were always truly of
      God, then would it always be the strongest. The question which brings
      Monsignor Del Fortis here as special emissary of the Vicar-General of the
      Society of Jesus, is simply this: Whether or no a certain site in a
      particularly fertile tract of land belonging chiefly to the Crown, shall
      be granted to the Jesuits for the purpose of building thereon a church and
      monastery with schools attached. It seems a reasonable request, set forth
      with an apparently religious intention. Yet more than forty petitions have
      been sent in to me from the inhabitants of the towns and villages adjacent
      to the lands, imploring me to refuse the concession. By my faith, they
      plead as eloquently as though asking deliverance from the plague! It is a
      curious dilemma. If I grant the people's request I anger the priests; if I
      satisfy the priests I anger the people."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You mentioned a discussion in the Press, Sir&mdash;" hinted Sir Roger.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, the Press is like a weathercock&mdash;it turns whichever way the wind
      of speculation blows. One day it is 'for,' another 'against.' In this
      particular case it is diplomatically indifferent, except in one or two
      cases where papal money has found its way into the newspaper offices."
    </p>
    <p>
      At that moment the door was flung open, and Monsignor Del Fortis was
      ceremoniously ushered into the presence of his Majesty. At the first
      glance it was evident that De Launay had reasonable cause for associating
      the mediaeval priestly torturer pictured in his early lesson-book with the
      unprepossessing personage now introduced. Del Fortis was a dark,
      resentful-looking man of about sixty, tall and thin, with a long
      cadaverous face, very strongly pronounced features and small sinister
      eyes, over which the level brows almost met across the sharp bridge of
      nose. His close black garb buttoned to the chin, outlined his wiry angular
      limbs with an almost painful distinctness, and the lean right hand which
      he placed across his breast as he bowed profoundly to the King, looked
      more like the shrunken hand of a corpse than that of a living man. The
      King observed him attentively, but not with favour; while thoughts,
      strange, and for him as a constitutional monarch audacious, began to move
      in the undercurrents of his mind, stirring him to unusual speech and
      action. Sir Roger, retiring to the furthest end of the room stood with his
      back against the door, a fine upright soldierly figure, as motionless as
      though cast in bronze, though his eyes showed keen and sparkling life as
      they rested on his Royal master, watching his every gesture, as well as
      every slightest movement on the part of his priestly visitor.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are welcome, Monsignor Del Fortis,"&mdash;said the King, at last
      breaking silence.&mdash;"To save time and trouble, I may tell you that I
      need no explanation of the nature of your business."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Jesuit bowed with an excessive humility.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You wish me to grant to your Society," continued the monarch&mdash;"that
      portion of the Crown lands named in your petition, to be held in your
      undisputed possession for a long term of years,&mdash;and in order to
      facilitate my consent to this arrangement, your Vicar-General has sent you
      here to furnish the full details of your building scheme. Am I so far
      correct?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The priest's dark secretive eyes glittered craftily a moment as he raised
      them to the open and tranquil countenance of the sovereign,&mdash;then
      once again he bowed profoundly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your Majesty has, with your customary care and patience, fully studied
      the object of my errand"&mdash;he replied in a clear thin, somewhat
      rasping voice, which he endeavoured to make smooth and conciliatory&mdash;"But
      it is impossible that your Majesty, immersed every day in the affairs of
      state, should have found time to personally go through the various papers
      formally submitted to your consideration. Therefore, the Vicar-General of
      our Order considered that if the present interview with your Majesty could
      be obtained, I, as secretary and treasurer for the proposed new monastery,
      might be able to explain the spiritual, as well as the material advantages
      to be gained by the use of the lands for the purpose mentioned."
    </p>
    <p>
      He spoke slowly, enunciating each word with careful distinctness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The spiritual part of the scheme is of course the most important to you!"&mdash;said
      the King with a slight smile,&mdash;"But material advantages are never
      entirely overlooked, even by holy men! Now I am merely a 'temporal'
      sovereign; and as such, I wish to know how your plan will affect the
      people of the neighbouring town and district. What are your intentions
      towards them? Their welfare is my chief concern; and what I have to learn
      from you is,&mdash;How do you propose to benefit them by maintaining a
      monastery, church and schools in their vicinity?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Again Del Fortis gave a furtive glance upward. Seeing that the King's eyes
      were steadily fixed upon him, he quickly lowered his own, and gave answer
      in an evidently prepared manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sir, the people of the district in question are untaught barbarians. It
      is more for their sakes,&mdash;more for the love of gathering the lost
      sheep into the fold, than for our own satisfaction, that we seek to pitch
      our tents in the desert of their ignorance. They, and their children, are
      the prey of heathenish modern doctrines, which alas!&mdash;are too
      prevalent throughout the whole world at this particular time,&mdash;and,
      as they are at present situated, no restraint is exercised upon them for
      the better controlling of their natural and inherited vices. Unless the
      gentle hand of Mother Church is allowed to rescue these, her hapless and
      neglected ones; unless she has an opportunity afforded her of leading them
      out of the darkness of error into the light of eternal day&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      He broke off, his eloquence being interrupted by a gesture from the King.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is a Government school in the town,"&mdash;said the monarch,
      referring to one or two documents on the table before him.&mdash;"There is
      also a Free Public Library, and a Free School of Art. Thus it does not
      seem that education is quite neglected."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Alas, Sir, such education is merely disastrous!" said Del Fortis, with a
      deep sigh,&mdash;"Like the fruit on the tree of knowledge in the Garden of
      Eden, it brings death to the soul!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You condemn the Government methods?" asked the King coldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Jesuit moved uneasily, and a dull flush reddened his pale skin.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Far be it from me, Sir, as a poor servant of the Church, to condemn
      lawful authorities,&mdash;yet we should not forget that the Government is
      temporal and changeable,&mdash;the Church is spiritual and changeless. We
      cannot look for entire success in a scheme of popular education which is
      not formulated under the guidance or the blessing of God!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The King leaned forward a little in his chair, and surveyed him fixedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How do you know that it is not formulated under the guidance and blessing
      of God?" he asked suddenly&mdash;"Has the Almighty given you His special
      opinion and confidence on the matter?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Monsignor Del Fortis started indignantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sir! Your Majesty&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      De Launay made a step forward, but the King motioned him back. Accordingly
      he resumed his former position, but his equable temperament was for once
      seriously disturbed. He saw that his Royal master was evidently bent on
      speaking his mind; and he knew well what a dangerous indulgence that is
      for all men who desire peace and quietness in their lives.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am aware of what you would say," pursued the King&mdash;"You would say
      that the Church&mdash;your Church&mdash;is the only establishment of the
      kind which receives direct inspiration from the Creator of Universes. But
      I do not feel justified in limiting the control of the Almighty to one
      special orbit of Creed. You tell me that a government system of education
      for the people is a purely temporal movement, and that, as such, it is not
      blessed by the guidance of God. Yet the Pope seeks 'temporal' power! It is
      explained to us of course that he seeks it in order that he may unite it
      to the spiritual in his own person,&mdash;theoretically for the good of
      mankind, if practically for the advancement of his own particular policy.
      But have you never thought, Monsignor, that the marked severance of what
      you call 'temporal' power, from what you equally call 'spiritual' power,
      is God's work? Inasmuch as nothing can be done without God's will; for
      even if there is a devil (which I am inclined to doubt) he owes his
      unhappy existence to God as much as I do!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He smiled; but Del Fortis stood rigidly silent, his head bent, and one
      hand folded tight across his breast, an attitude Sir Roger de Launay
      always viewed in every man with suspicion, as it suggested the concealment
      of a weapon.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will admit" pursued the King, "that the action of human thought is
      always progressive. Unfortunately your Creed lags behind human thought in
      its onward march, thus causing the intelligent world to infer that there
      must be something wrong with its teaching. For if the Church had always
      been in all respects faithful to the teaching of her Divine Master, she
      would be at this present time the supreme Conqueror of Nations. Yet she is
      doing no more nowadays than she did in the middle ages,&mdash;she
      threatens, she intimidates, she persecutes all who dare to use for a
      reasonable purpose the brain God gave them,&mdash;but she does not help on
      or sympathize with the growing fraternity and civilization of the world.
      It is impossible not to recognize this. Yet I have a profound respect for
      each and every minister of religion who honestly endeavours to follow the
      counsels of Christ,"&mdash;here he paused,&mdash;then added with slow and
      marked emphasis&mdash;"in whose Holy Name I devoutly believe for the
      redemption of whatever there is in me worth redeeming;&mdash;nevertheless
      my first duty, even in Christ, is plainly to the people of the country
      over which I am elected to rule."
    </p>
    <p>
      The flickering shadow of a smile passed over the Jesuit's dark features,
      but he still kept silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Therefore," went on the King&mdash;"it is my unpleasant task to be
      compelled to inform you, Monsignor, that the inhabitants of the district
      your Order seeks to take under its influence, have the strongest objection
      to your presence among them. So strong indeed is their aversion towards
      your Society, that they have petitioned me in numerous ways, (and with
      considerable eloquence, too, for 'untaught barbarians') to defend them
      from your visitation. Now, to speak truly, I find they have all the
      advantages which modern advancement and social improvement can give them,&mdash;they
      attend their places of public worship in considerable numbers, and are on
      the whole decent, God-fearing, order-loving subjects to the Throne,&mdash;and
      more I do not desire for them or for myself. Criminal cases are very rare
      in the district,&mdash;and the poor are more inclined to help than to
      defraud each other. All this is so far good,&mdash;and, I should imagine,&mdash;not
      displeasing to God. In any case, as their merely temporal sovereign, I
      must decline to give your Order any control over them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You refuse the concession of land, Sir?" said Del Fortis, in a voice that
      trembled with restrained passion.
    </p>
    <p>
      "To satisfy those of my subjects who have appealed to me, I am compelled
      to do so," replied the King.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I pray your Majesty's pardon, but a portion of the land is held by
      private persons who are prepared to sell to us&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      A quick anger flashed in the King's eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "They shall sell to me if they sell at all,"&mdash;he said,&mdash;"I
      repeat, Monsignor, the fact that the law-abiding people of the place have
      sought their King's protection from priestly interference;&mdash;and,&mdash;by
      Heaven!&mdash;they shall have it!"
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a sudden silence. Sir Roger de Launay drew a sharp breath,&mdash;his
      habitual languor of mind was completely dissipated, and he studied the
      inscrutable face of Del Fortis with deepening suspicion and disfavour. Not
      that there was the slightest sign of wrath or dismay on the priest's
      well-disciplined countenance;&mdash;on the contrary, a chill smile
      illumined it as he spoke his next words with a serious, if somewhat forced
      composure.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your Majesty is, without doubt, all powerful in your own particular
      domain of society and politics," he said&mdash;"But there is another
      Majesty higher than yours,&mdash;that of the Church, before which dread
      and infallible Tribunal even kings are brought to naught&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Monsignor Del Fortis," interrupted the King, "We have not met this
      morning, I presume, to indulge in a religious polemic! My power is, as you
      very truly suggest, merely temporal&mdash;yours is spiritual. Yours should
      be the strongest! Go your way now to your Vicar-General with the straight
      answer I have given you,&mdash;but if by your 'spiritual' power you can
      persuade the people who now hate your Society, to love it,&mdash;to demand
      it,&mdash;to beg that you may be permitted to found a colony among them,&mdash;why,
      in that case, come to me again, and I will grant you the land. I am not
      prejudiced one way or the other, but I will not hand over any of my
      subjects to the influence of priestcraft, so long as they desire me to
      defend them from it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Del Fortis still smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pardon me, Sir, but we of the Society of Jesus are your subjects also,
      and we judge you to be a Christian and Catholic monarch&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "As I am, most assuredly!" replied the King&mdash;"Christian and Catholic
      are words which, if I understand their meaning, please me well!
      'Christian' expresses a believer in and follower of Christ,&mdash;'Catholic'
      means universal, by which, I take it, is intended wide, universal love and
      tolerance without sect, party, or prejudice. In this sense the Church is
      not Catholic&mdash;it is merely the Roman sect. Nor are you truly my
      subjects, since you have only one ruler, the Supreme Pontiff,&mdash;with
      whom I am somewhat at variance. But, as I have said, we are not here to
      indulge in argument. You came to proffer a request; I have given you the
      only answer I conceive fitting with my duty;&mdash;the matter is
      concluded."
    </p>
    <p>
      Del Fortis hesitated a moment,&mdash;then bowed low to the ground;&mdash;anon,
      lifting himself, raised one hand with an invocative gesture of profound
      solemnity.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I commend your Majesty to the mercy of God, that He may in His wisdom,
      guard your life and soften your heart towards the ministers of His Holy
      Religion, and bring you into the ways of righteousness and peace! For the
      rest, I will report your Majesty's decision to the Vicar-General."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do so!"&mdash;rejoined the King&mdash;"And assure him that the decision
      is unalterable,&mdash;unless the inhabitants of the place concerned desire
      to have it revoked."
    </p>
    <p>
      Again Del Fortis bowed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I humbly take my leave of your Majesty!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The monarch looked at him steadfastly as he made another salutation, and
      backed out of the presence-chamber. Sir Roger de Launay opened the door
      for him with alacrity, handing him over into the charge of an usher with
      the whispered caution to see him well off the Royal premises; and then
      returning to his sovereign, stood "at attention." The King noted his
      somewhat troubled aspect, and laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What ails you, De Launay?" he asked&mdash;"You seem astonished that for
      once I have spoken my mind?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sir, to speak one's mind is always dangerous!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dangerous&mdash;danger!&mdash;What idle words to make cowards of men!
      Danger&mdash;of what? There is only one danger&mdash;death; and that is
      sure to come to every man, whether he be a hero or a poltroon."
    </p>
    <p>
      "True,&mdash;but&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But&mdash;what? De Launay, if you love me, do not look at me with so
      expostulatory an air! It does not become your inches! Now listen!&mdash;when
      the next press reporter comes nosing round for palace news, let him be
      told that the King has refused permission to the Jesuits to build on any
      portion of the Crown lands demanded for the purpose. Let this be made
      known to Press and People&mdash;the sooner the better!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sir," murmured De Launay&mdash;"We live in strange times&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, there you speak most truly!" said the King, with emphasis&mdash;"We
      do live in strange times&mdash;the very strangest perhaps, since Aeneas
      Sylvius wrote concerning Christendom. Do you remember the words he set
      down so long ago?&mdash;'It is a body without a head,&mdash;a republic
      without laws or magistrates. The pope or the emperor may shine as lofty
      titles, as splendid images,&mdash;but they are unable to command, and no
      one is willing to obey!' History thus repeats itself, De Launay;&mdash;and
      yet with all its past experience, the Roman Church does not seem to
      realize that it is powerless against the attacks of intellectual common
      sense. Faith in God,&mdash;a high, perfect, pure faith in God, and a
      simple following of the Divine Teacher of God's command, Christ;&mdash;these
      things are wise and necessary for all nations; but, to allow human beings
      to be coerced by superstition for political motives, under the disguise of
      religion, is an un-Christian business, and I for one will have no part in
      it!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will lay yourself open to much serious misconstruction, Sir," said De
      Launay.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let us hope so, Roger!" rejoined the King with a smile&mdash;"For if I am
      never misunderstood, I shall know myself to be a fool! Come,&mdash;do not
      look so glum!&mdash;I want you to help me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "To help you, Sir?" exclaimed De Launay eagerly,&mdash;"With my life, if
      you demand it!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The King rested one hand familiarly on his shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I would rather take my own life than yours, De Launay!" he said&mdash;"No,&mdash;whatever
      difficulties I get myself into, you shall not suffer! But&mdash;as I told
      you a while ago,&mdash;there is something in me that must have its way. I
      am sick to death of conventionalities,&mdash;you must help me to break
      through them! You are right in saying that we live in strange times;&mdash;they
      are strange times!&mdash;and they may perchance be all the better for a
      strange King!"

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IV. &mdash; SEALED ORDERS
    </h2>
    <p>
      Some hours later on, Sir Roger de Launay, having left his Sovereign's
      presence, and being off duty for a time, betook himself to certain
      apartments in the west wing of the palace, where the next most trusted
      personage to himself in the confidence of the King, had his domicile,&mdash;Professor
      von Glauben, resident physician to the Royal Household. Heinrich von
      Glauben was a man of somewhat extraordinary character and individuality.
      In his youth he had made a sudden meteoric fame for his marvellous skill
      and success in surgery, as also for his equally surprising quickness and
      correctness in diagnosing obscure diseases and tracing them to their
      source. But, after creating a vast amount of discussion and opposition
      among his confrères, and almost reaching that brilliant point of triumph
      when his originality and cleverness were proved great enough to win him a
      host of enemies, he all at once threw up the game as it were, and,
      resigning the favourable opportunities of increasing distinction offered
      him in his native Germany, accepted the comparatively retired and private
      position he now occupied. Some said it was a disappointment in love which
      had caused his abrupt departure from the Fatherland,&mdash;others declared
      it was irritation at the severe manner in which his surgical successes had
      been handled by the medical critics,&mdash;but whatever the cause, it soon
      became evident that he had turned his back on the country of his birth for
      ever, and that he was apparently entirely satisfied with the lot he had
      chosen. His post was certainly an easy and pleasant one,&mdash;the members
      of the Royal family to which his services were attached were exceptionally
      healthy, as Royal families go; and he was seldom in more than merely
      formal attendance, so that he had ample time and opportunity to pursue
      those deeper forms of physiological study which had excited the wrath and
      ridicule of his contemporaries, as well as to continue the writing of a
      book which he intended should make a stir in the world, and which he had
      entitled "The Moral and Political History of Hunger."
    </p>
    <p>
      "For," said he&mdash;"Hunger is the primal civilizer,&mdash;the very
      keystone and foundation of all progress. From the plain, prosy, earthy
      fact that man is a hungry animal, and must eat, has sprung all the
      civilization of the world! I shall demonstrate this in my book, beginning
      with the scriptural legend of Adam's greed for an apple. Adam was
      evidently hungry at the moment Eve tempted him. As soon as he had
      satisfied his inner man, he thought of his outer,&mdash;and his next idea
      was, naturally, tailoring. From this simple conjunction of suggestions,
      combined with what 'God' would have to say to him concerning his
      food-experiment and fig-leaf apron, man has drawn all his religions,
      manners, customs and morals. The proposition is self-evident,&mdash;but I
      intend to point it out with somewhat emphasised clearness for the benefit
      of those persons who are inclined to arrogate to themselves the possession
      of superior wisdom. Neither brain nor soul has placed man in a position of
      Supremacy,&mdash;merely Hunger and Nakedness!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The Professor was now about fifty-five, but his exceptionally powerful
      build and robust constitution gave him the grace in appearance of many
      years younger, though perhaps the extreme composure of his temperament,
      and the philosophic manner in which he viewed all circumstances, whether
      pleasing or disastrous, may have exercised the greatest influence in
      keeping his eyes clear and clean, and his countenance free of unhandsome
      wrinkles. He was more like a soldier than a doctor, and was proud of his
      resemblance to the earlier portraits of Bismarck. To see him in his own
      particular 'sanctum' surrounded by weird-looking diagrams of sundry parts
      of the human frame, mysterious phials and stoppered flasks containing
      various liquids and crystals, and all the modern appliances for closely
      examining the fearful yet beautiful secrets of the living organism, was as
      if one should look upon a rough and burly giant engaged in some delicate
      manipulation of mosaics. Yet Von Glauben's large hand was gentler than a
      woman's in its touch and gift of healing,&mdash;no surgeon alive could
      probe a wound more tenderly, or with less pain to the sufferer,&mdash;and
      the skill of that large hand was accompanied by the penetrative quality of
      the large benevolent brain which guided it,&mdash;a brain that could
      encompass the whole circle of the world in its observant and affectionate
      compassion.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ach!&mdash;who is there that can be angry with anyone?&mdash;impatient
      with anyone,&mdash;offended with anyone!" he was wont to say&mdash;"Everybody
      suffers so much and so undeservedly, that as far as my short life goes I
      have only time for pity&mdash;not condemnation!"
    </p>
    <p>
      To this individual, as a kind of human calmative and tonic combined, Sir
      Roger de Launay was in the habit of going whenever he felt his own
      customary tranquillity at all disturbed. The two were great friends;&mdash;friends
      in their mutual love and service of the King,&mdash;friends in their
      equally mutual but discreetly silent worship of the Queen,&mdash;and
      friends in their very differences of opinion on men and matters in
      general. De Launay, being younger, was more hasty of judgment and quick in
      action; but Von Glauben too had been known to draw his sword with
      unexpected rapidity on occasion, to the discomfiture of those who deemed
      him only at home with the scalpel. Just now, however, he was in a
      particularly non-combative and philosophic mood; he was watching certain
      animalculae wriggling in a glass tube, the while he sat in a large
      easy-chair with slippered feet resting on another chair opposite, puffing
      clouds of smoke from a big meerschaum,&mdash;and he did not stir from his
      indolent attitude when De Launay entered, but merely looked up and smiled
      placidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sit down, Roger!" he said,&mdash;then, as De Launay obeyed the
      invitation, he pushed over a box of cigars, and added&mdash;"You look
      exceedingly tired, my friend! Something has bored you more than usual?
      Take a lesson from those interesting creatures!" and he pointed with the
      stem of his pipe to the bottled animalculae&mdash;"They are never bored,&mdash;never
      weary of doing mischief! They are just now living under the pleasing
      delusion that the glass tube they are in is a man, and that they are
      eating him up alive. Little devils! Nothing will exhaust their vitality
      till they have gorged themselves to death! Just like a great many human
      beings!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am not in the mood for studying animalculae," said De Launay irritably,
      as he lit a cigar.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No? But why not? They are really quite as interesting as ourselves!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Look here, Von Glauben, I want you to be serious&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My friend, I am always serious," declared the Professor&mdash;"Even when
      I laugh, I laugh seriously. My laughter is as real as myself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What would you think,"&mdash;pursued De Launay&mdash;"of a king who
      freely expressed his own opinions?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I should say he was a brave man," answered the Professor; "He would
      certainly deserve my respect, and he should have it. Even if the laws of
      etiquette were not existent, I should feel justified in taking off my hat
      to him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never from henceforth wear a hat at all then," said De Launay&mdash;"It
      will save you the trouble of continually doffing it at every glimpse of
      his Majesty!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Von Glauben drew his pipe from his mouth and gazed blankly at the ceiling
      for a few moments in silence. "His Majesty?" he presently murmured&mdash;"Our
      Majesty?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes; our Majesty&mdash;our King"&mdash;replied De Launay&mdash;"For some
      inscrutable reason or other he has suddenly adopted the dangerous policy
      of speaking his mind. What now?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What now? Why nothing particular just now,&mdash;unless you have
      something to tell me. Which, judging from your entangled expression of
      eye, I presume you have."
    </p>
    <p>
      De Launay hesitated a moment. The Professor saw his hesitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do not speak, my friend, if you think you are committing a breach of
      confidence," he said composedly&mdash;"In the brief affairs of this life,
      it is better to keep trouble on your own mind than impart it to others."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, there is no breach of confidence;" said De Launay, "The thing is as
      public as the day, or if it is not public already, it soon will be made
      so. That is where the mischief comes in,&mdash;or so I think. Judge for
      yourself!" And in a few words he gave the gist of the interview which had
      taken place between the King and the emissary of the Jesuits that morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing surprises me as a rule,"&mdash;said the Professor, when he had
      heard all&mdash;"But if anything could prick the sense of astonishment
      anew in me, it would be to think that anyone, king or commoner, should
      take the trouble to speak truth to a Jesuit. Why, the very essence of
      their carefully composed and diplomatic creed, is to so disguise truth
      that it shall be no more recognisable. Myself, I believe the Jesuits to be
      the lineal descendants of those priests who served Bel and the Dragon. The
      art of conjuring and deception is in their very blood. It is for the
      Jesuits that I have invented a beautiful new verb,&mdash;'To hypocrise.'
      It sounds well. Here is the present tense,&mdash;'I hypocrise, Thou
      hypocrisest, He hypocrises:&mdash;We hypocrise, You hypocrise, They
      hypocrise.' Now hear the future. 'I shall hypocrise, Thou shalt hypocrise,
      He shall hypocrise; We shall hypocrise, You shall hypocrise, They shall
      hypocrise.' There is the whole art of Jesuitry for you, made grammatically
      perfect!"
    </p>
    <p>
      De Launay gave a gesture of impatience, and flung away the end of his
      half-smoked cigar.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ach! That is a sign of temper, Roger!" said Von Glauben, shaking his head&mdash;"To
      lift one's shoulders to the lobes of one's ears, and waste nearly the half
      of an exceedingly expensive and choice Havana, shows nervous irritation!
      You are angry, my friend&mdash;and with me!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No I am not," replied De Launay, rising from his chair and beginning to
      pace the room&mdash;"But I do not profess to have your phlegmatic
      disposition. I feel what I thought you would feel also,&mdash;that the
      King is exposing himself to unnecessary danger. And I know what you do not
      yet know, but what this letter will no doubt inform you,"&mdash;and he
      drew an envelope bearing the Royal seal from his pocket and handed it to
      the Professor&mdash;"Namely,&mdash;that his Majesty is bent on rushing
      voluntarily into various other perils, unless perhaps, your warning or
      advice may hinder him. Mine has no effect,&mdash;moreover I am bound to
      serve him as he bids."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Equally am I also bound to serve him;"&mdash;said Von Glauben, "And
      gladly and faithfully do I intend to perform my service wherever it may
      lead me!" Whereupon, shaking himself out of his recumbent position, like a
      great lion rolling out of his lair, he stood upright, and breaking the
      seal of the envelope he held, read its contents through in silence. Sir
      Roger stood opposite to him, watching his face in vain for any sign of
      astonishment, regret or dismay.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We must do as he commands,"&mdash;he said simply as he finished reading
      the letter and folded it up for safe keeping&mdash;"There is no other way;
      not for me at least. I shall most assuredly be at the appointed place, at
      the appointed hour, and in the appointed manner. It will be a change;
      certainly lively, and possibly beneficial!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But the King's life&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is in God's keeping!" said Von Glauben,&mdash;"Believe me, Roger, no harm
      comes undeservedly to a brave man with a good conscience! It is a bad
      conscience which invites mischief. I am a great believer in the law of
      attraction. The good attracts the good,&mdash;the bad, the bad. That is
      why truthful persons are generally lonely&mdash;because nearly all the
      world's inhabitants are liars!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But the King&mdash;" again began Sir Roger.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The King is a man!" said Von Glauben, with a flash of pride in his eyes&mdash;"Which
      is more than I will say for most kings! Who shall blame him for asserting
      his manhood? Not I! Not you! Who shall blame him for seeking to know the
      real position of things in the country he governs? Not I! Not you! Our
      business is to guard and defend him&mdash;with our own lives, if
      necessary,&mdash;we shall do that with a will, Roger, shall we not?" And
      with an impulsive quickness of action, he took a sword from a stand of
      weapons near him, drew it from its scabbard and kissing the hilt, held it
      out to De Launay who did the same&mdash;"That is understood! And for the
      rest, Roger my friend, take it all lightly and easily&mdash;as a farce!&mdash;as
      a bit of human comedy, with a great actor cast for the chief role. We are
      only supers, you and I, but we shall do well to stand near the wings in
      case of fire!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He drew himself up to his great height and squared his shoulders,&mdash;then
      smiled benevolently.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I believe it will be all very amusing, Roger; and that your fears for the
      safety of his Majesty will be proved groundless. Remember, Court life is
      excessively dull,&mdash;truly the dullest form of existence on earth,&mdash;it
      is quite natural that he who is the most bored by it should desire some
      break in the terrible monotony!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The monotony will certainly be broken with a vengeance, if the King
      continues in his present humour!"&mdash;said De Launay grimly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Possibly! And let us hope the comfortable self-assurance and complacency
      of a certain successful Minister may be somewhat seriously disturbed!"
      rejoined Von Glauben,&mdash;"For myself, I assure you I see sport!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And I scent danger,"&mdash;said De Launay&mdash;"For if any mischance
      happen to the King, the Prince is not ripe enough to rule."
    </p>
    <p>
      A slight shadow darkened the Professor's open countenance. He looked
      fixedly at Sir Roger, who met his gaze with equal fixity.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Prince,"&mdash;he said slowly&mdash;"is young&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And rash&mdash;" interposed De Launay.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No. Pardon me, my friend! Not rash. Merely honest. That is all! He is a
      very honest young man indeed. It is unfortunate that he is so; a ploughman
      may be honest if he likes, but a prince&mdash;never!"
    </p>
    <p>
      De Launay was silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will now destroy a world"&mdash;continued Von Glauben, "Kings,
      emperors, popes, councillors and common folk, can all perish
      incontinently,&mdash;as&mdash;being myself for the present the free agent
      of the Deity concerned in the matter,&mdash;I have something else to do
      than to look after them,"&mdash;and he took up the glass vessel containing
      the animalculae he had been watching, and cast it with its contents into a
      small stove burning dimly at one end of the apartment,&mdash;"Gone are
      their ambitions and confabulations for ever! How easy for the Creator to
      do the same thing with us, Roger! Let us not talk of any special danger
      for the King or for any man, seeing that we are all on the edge of an
      eternal volcano!"
    </p>
    <p>
      De Launay stood absorbed for a moment, as if in deep thought. Then rousing
      himself abruptly he said:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will not see the King, and speak with him before to-morrow night?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why should I?" queried the Professor. "His wish is a command which I must
      obey. Besides, my good Roger, all the arguments in the world will not turn
      a man from having his own way if he has once made up his own mind. Advice
      from me on the present matter would be merely taken as an impertinence.
      Moreover I have no advice to give,&mdash;I rather approve of the plan!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Roger looked at him; and noting the humorous twinkle in his eyes
      smiled, though somewhat gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hope, with you, that the experiment may only prove an amusing one," he
      said&mdash;"But life is not always a farce!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not always, but often! When it is not a farce it is a tragedy. And such a
      tragedy! My God! Horrible&mdash;monstrous&mdash;cruel beyond conception,
      and enough to make one believe in Hell and doubt Heaven!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He spoke passionately, in a voice vibrating with strong emotion. De Launay
      glanced at him wonderingly, but did not speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      "When you see tender young children tortured by disease," he went on,&mdash;"Fair
      and gentle women made the victims of outrage and brutality&mdash;strong
      men killed in their thousands to gain a little additional gold, an extra
      slice of empire,&mdash;then you see the tragic, the inexplicable, the
      crazy cruelty of putting into us this little pulse called Life. But I try
      not to think of this&mdash;it is no use thinking!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He paused,&mdash;then in his usual quiet tone said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "To-morrow night, then, my friend?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "To-morrow night," rejoined De Launay,&mdash;"Unless you receive further
      instructions from the King."
    </p>
    <p>
      At that moment the clear call of a trumpet echoing across the battlements
      of the palace denoted the hour for changing the sentry. "Sunset already!"
      said Von Glauben, walking to the window and throwing back the heavy
      curtain which partially shaded it, "And yonder is Prince Humphry's yacht
      on its homeward way."
    </p>
    <p>
      De Launay came and stood beside him, looking out. Before them the sea
      glistened with a thousand tints of lustrous opal in the light of the
      sinking sun, which, surrounded by mountainous heights of orange and purple
      cloud, began to touch the water-line with a thousand arrowy darts of
      flame. The white-sailed vessel on which their eyes were fixed, came
      curtseying over the waves through a perfect arch of splendid colour, like
      a fairy or phantom ship evoked from a poet's dream.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Absent all day, as he has been," said De Launay, "his Royal Highness is
      punctual to the promised hour of his return."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He is, as I told you, honest;" said Von Glauben, "and it is possible his
      honesty will be his misfortune."
    </p>
    <p>
      De Launay muttered something inaudible in answer, and turned to leave the
      apartment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Von Glauben looked at him with an affectionate solicitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What a lucky thing it is you never married, Roger! Otherwise you would
      now be going to tell your wife all about the King's plans! Then she, sweet
      creature, would go to confession,&mdash;and her confessor would tell a
      bishop,&mdash;and a bishop would tell a cardinal,&mdash;and a cardinal
      would tell a confidential monsignor,&mdash;and the confidential monsignor
      would tell the Supreme Pontiff,&mdash;and so all the world would be
      ringing with the news started by one little pretty wagging tongue of a
      woman!"
    </p>
    <p>
      A faint flush coloured De Launay's bronzed cheek, but he laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "True! I am glad I have never married. I am still more glad&mdash;of
      circumstances"&mdash;he paused,&mdash;then went on, "which have so chanced
      to me that I shall never marry." He paused again&mdash;then added&mdash;"I
      must be gone, Von Glauben! I have to meet Prince Humphry at the quay with
      a message from his Majesty."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Surely," said the Professor, opening his eyes very wide, "The Prince is
      not to be included in our adventure?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "By no means!" replied De Launay,&mdash;"But the King is not pleased with
      his son's frequent absences from Court, and desires to speak with him on
      the matter."
    </p>
    <p>
      Von Glauben looked grave.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There will be some little trouble there," he said, with a half sigh&mdash;"Ach!
      Who knows! Perhaps some great trouble!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Heaven forbid!" ejaculated Sir Roger,&mdash;"We live in times of peace.
      We want no dissension with either the King or the people. Till to-morrow
      night then?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Till to-morrow night!" responded Von Glauben, whereupon Sir Roger with a
      brief word of farewell, strode away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Left to himself, the Professor still stood at his window watching the
      approach of the Prince's yacht, which came towards the shore with such
      swift and stately motion through the portals of the sunset, over the
      sparkling water.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Unfortunate Humphry!" he muttered,&mdash;"What a secret he has entrusted
      me with! And yet why do I call him unfortunate? There should be nothing to
      regret&mdash;and yet&mdash;! Well! The mischief was done before poor
      Heinrich von Glauben was consulted; and if poor Heinrich were God and the
      Devil rolled into one strange Eternal Monster, he could not have prevented
      it! What is done, can never be undone!"

    <h2>
      CHAPTER V. &mdash; "IF I LOVED YOU!"
    </h2>
    <p>
      A singular pomp is sometimes associated with the announcement that my Lord
      Pedigree, or Mister Nobody has 'had the honour of dining' with their
      Majesties the King and Queen. Outsiders read the thrilling line with awe
      and envy,&mdash;and many of them are foolish enough to wish that they also
      were Lords Pedigree or Misters Nobody. As a matter of sad and sober fact,
      however, a dinner with royal personages is an extremely dull affair. 'Do
      not speak unless you are spoken to,' is a rule which, however excellent
      and necessary in Court etiquette, is apt to utterly quench conversation,
      and render the brightest spirits dull and inert. The silent and solemn
      movements of the Court flunkeys,&mdash;the painful attitudes of those who
      are <i>not</i> 'spoken to'; the eager yet laboured smiles of those who <i>are</i>
      'spoken to ';&mdash;the melancholy efforts at gaiety&mdash;the dread of
      trespassing on tabooed subjects&mdash;these things tend to make all but
      the most independent and unfettered minds shrink from such an ordeal as
      the 'honour' of dining with kings. It must, however, be conceded that the
      kings themselves are fully aware of the tediousness of their dinner
      parties, and would lighten the boredom if they could; but etiquette
      forbids. The particular monarch whose humours are the subject of this
      'plain unvarnished' history would have liked nothing better than to be
      allowed to dine in simplicity and peace without his conversation being
      noted, and without having a flunkey at hand to watch every morsel of food
      go into his mouth. He would have liked to eat freely, talk freely, and
      conduct himself generally with the ease of a private gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this being denied to him, he hated the dinner-hour as ardently as he
      hated receiving illuminated addresses, and the freedom of cities. Yet all
      things costly and beautiful were combined to make his royal table a
      picture which would have pleased the eyes and taste of a Marguerite de
      Valois. On the evening of the day on which he had determined, as he had
      said to himself, to 'begin to reign,' it looked more than usually
      attractive. Some trifling chance had made the floral decorations more
      tasteful&mdash;some amiable humour of the providence which rules daily
      events, had ordained that two or three of the prettiest Court ladies
      should be present;&mdash;Prince Humphry and his two brothers, Rupert and
      Cyprian, were at table,&mdash;and though conversation was slow and scant,
      the picturesqueness of the scene was not destroyed by silence. The
      apartment which was used as a private dining-room when their Majesties had
      no guests save the members of their own household, was in itself a gem of
      art and architecture,&mdash;it had been designed and painted from floor to
      ceiling by one of the most famous of the dead and gone masters, and its
      broad windows opened out on a white marble loggia fronting the ocean,
      where festoons of flowers clambered and hung, in natural tufts and trails
      of foliage and blossom, mingling their sweet odours with the fresh scent
      of the sea. Amid all the glow and delicacy of colour, the crowning
      perfection of the perfect environment was the Queen-Consort, lovelier in
      her middle-age than most women in their teens. An exquisite figure of
      stateliness and dignity, robed in such hues and adorned with such jewels
      as best suited her statuesque beauty, and attended by ladies of whose more
      youthful charms she was never envious, having indeed no cause for envy,
      she was a living defiance to the ravages of time, and graced her royal
      husband's dinner-table with the same indifferent ease as she graced his
      throne, unchanging in the dazzling light of her physical faultlessness.
      He, looking at her with mingled impatience and sadness, almost wished she
      would grow older in appearance with her years, and lose that perfect skin,
      white as alabaster,&mdash;that glittering but cold luminance of eye. For
      experience had taught him the worthlessness of beauty unaccompanied by
      tenderness, and fair faces had no longer the first attraction for him. His
      eldest son, Prince Humphry, bore a strong resemblance to himself,&mdash;he
      was tall and slim, with a fine face, and a well-built muscular figure; the
      other two younger princes, Rupert and Cyprian, aged respectively eighteen
      and sixteen, were like their mother,&mdash;beautiful in form and feature,
      but as indifferent to all tenderness of thought and sentiment as they were
      full of splendid health and vigour. And, despite the fact that the
      composition and surroundings of his household were, to all outward
      appearances, as satisfactory as a man in his position could expect them to
      be, the King was intellectually and spiritually aware of the emptiness of
      the shell he called 'home.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Love was lacking; his beautiful wife was the ice-wall against which all
      waves of feeling froze as they fell into the stillness of death. His sons
      had been born as the foals of a racing stud might be born,&mdash;merely to
      continue the line of blood and succession. They were not the dear
      offspring of passion or of tenderness. The coldness of their mother's
      nature was strongly engendered in them, and so far they had never shown
      any particular affection for their parents. The princes Rupert and Cyprian
      thought of nothing all day but sports and games of skill; they studied
      serious tasks unwillingly, and found their position as sons of the
      reigning monarch, irksome, and even ridiculous. They had caught the
      infection of that diseased idea which in various exaggerated forms is
      tending to become more or less universal, and to work great mischief to
      nations,&mdash;namely, that 'sport' is more important than policy, and
      that all matters relating to 'sport,' are more worth attention than wisdom
      in government. Of patriotism, or love of country they had none; and
      laughed to scorn the grand old traditions and sentiments of national glory
      and honour, which had formerly inspired the poets of their land to many a
      wild and beautiful chant of battle or of victory. How to pass the day&mdash;how
      best to amuse themselves&mdash;this was their first thought on waking
      every morning,&mdash;football, cricket, tennis and wrestling formed their
      chief subjects of conversation; and though they had professors and tutors
      of the most qualified and certificated ability, they made no secret of
      their utter contempt for all learning and literature. They were fine young
      animals; but did less with the brains bestowed upon them than the working
      bee who makes provision of honey for the winter, or the swallow that
      builds its nest under warmly sheltered eaves.
    </p>
    <p>
      Prince Humphry, however, was of a different nature. From a shy, somewhat
      unmanageable boy, he had developed into a quiet, dreamy youth, fond of
      books, music, and romantic surroundings. He avoided the company of his
      brothers whenever it was possible; their loud voices, boisterous spirits
      and perpetual chatter concerning the champions of this or that race or
      match, bored him infinitely, and he was at no pains to disguise his
      boredom. During the last year he seemed to have grown up suddenly into
      full manhood,&mdash;he had begun to assert his privileges as
      Heir-Apparent, and to enjoy the freedom his position allowed him. Yet the
      manner of his enjoyment was somewhat singular for a young man who formed a
      central figure in the circle of the land's Royalty,&mdash;he cared nothing
      at all for the amusements and dissipations of the time; he merely showed
      an abnormal love of solitude, which was highly unflattering to fashionable
      society. It was on this subject that the King had decided to speak with
      him,&mdash;and he watched him with closer attention than usual on this
      particular evening when his habit of absenting himself all day in his
      yacht had again excited comment. It was easy to see that the Prince had
      been annoyed by the message Sir Roger de Launay had conveyed to him on his
      arrival home,&mdash;a message to the effect that, as soon as dinner was
      concluded, he was required to attend his Majesty in private; and all
      through the stately and formal repast, his evident irritation and
      impatience cast a shadow of vague embarrassment over the royal party,&mdash;with
      the exception of the princes Rupert and Cyprian, who were never
      embarrassed by anything, and who were more apt to be amused than
      disquieted by the vexation of others. Welcome relief was at last given by
      the serving of coffee,&mdash;and the Queen and all her ladies adjourned to
      their own apartments. With their departure the rest of the circle soon
      dispersed, there being no special guests present; and at a sign from De
      Launay, Prince Humphry reluctantly followed his father into a small
      private smoking-room adjacent to the open loggia, where the equerry,
      bowing low, left the two together.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a moment the King kept silence, while he chose a cigar from the silver
      box on the table. Then, lighting it, he handed the box courteously to his
      son.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will you smoke, Humphry?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thanks, Sir,&mdash;no."
    </p>
    <p>
      The King seated himself; Prince Humphry remained standing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You had a favourable wind for your expedition today;" said the monarch at
      last, beginning to smoke placidly&mdash;"I observe that The Islands appear
      to have won special notice from you. What is the attraction? The climate
      or the scenery?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The Prince was silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I like fine scenery myself,&mdash;" continued the King&mdash;"I also like
      a change of air. But variation in both is always desirable,&mdash;and for
      this, it is unwise to go to the same place every day!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Still the Prince said nothing. His father looked up and studied his face
      attentively, but could guess nothing from its enigmatical expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You seem tongue-tied, Humphry!" he said&mdash;"Come, sit down! Let us
      talk this out. Can you not trust me, your father, as a friend?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wish I could!" answered the young man, half inaudibly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And can you not?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No. You have never loved me!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The King drew his cigar from his mouth, and flicking off a morsel of ash,
      looked at its end meditatively.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well&mdash;no!&mdash;I cannot say honestly that I have. Love,&mdash;it is
      a ridiculous word, Humphry, but it has a meaning on certain occasions!&mdash;love
      for the children of your mother is an impossibility!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sir, I am not to blame for my mother's disposition."
    </p>
    <p>
      "True&mdash;very true. You are not to blame. But you exist. And that you
      do exist is a fact of national importance. Will you not sit down?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "At your command, Sir!" and the Prince seated himself opposite his father,
      who having studied his cigar sufficiently, replaced it between his lips
      and went on smoking for a few minutes before he spoke again. Then he
      resumed:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your existence, I repeat, Humphry, is a fact of national importance. To
      you falls the Throne when I have done with it, and life has done with me.
      Therefore, your conduct,&mdash;your mode of life&mdash;your example in
      manners&mdash;concern, not me, so much as the nation. You say that you
      cannot trust me as a friend, because I have never loved you. Is not this a
      somewhat childish remark on your part? We live in a very practical age&mdash;love
      is not a necessary tie between human beings as things go nowadays;&mdash;the
      closest bond of friendship rests on the basis of cash accounts."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am perfectly aware of that!" said the Prince, fixing his fine dark eyes
      full on his father's face&mdash;"And yet, after all, love is such a vital
      necessity, that I have only to look at you, in order to realize the
      failure and mistake of trying to do without it!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The King gave him a glance of whimsical surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So!&mdash;you have begun to notice what I have known for years!" he said
      lightly&mdash;"Clever young man! What fine fairy finger is pointing out to
      you my deficiencies, while supplying your own? Do you learn to estimate
      the priceless value of love while contemplating the romantic groves and
      woodlands of The Islands? Do you read poetry there?&mdash;or write it? Or
      talk it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Prince Humphry coloured,&mdash;then grew very pale.
    </p>
    <p>
      "When I misuse my time, Sir," he said&mdash;"Surely it will then be
      needful to catechise me on the manner in which I spend it,&mdash;but not
      till then!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Fairly put!" answered the King&mdash;"But I have an idea&mdash;it may be
      a mistaken idea,&mdash;still I have it&mdash;that you <i>are</i> misusing
      your time, Humphry! And this is the cause of our present little
      discussion. If I knew that you occupied yourself with the pleasures
      befitting your age and rank, I should be more at ease."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you consider to be the pleasures befitting my age and rank?"
      asked the Prince with a touch of satire; "Making a fool of myself
      generally?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The King smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well!&mdash;it would be better to make a fool of yourself generally than
      particularly! Folly is not so harmful when spread like jam over a whole
      slice of bread,&mdash;but it may cause a life-long sickness, if swallowed
      in one secret gulp of sweetness!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The Prince moved uneasily.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You think I am catechising you,&mdash;and you resent it&mdash;but, my
      dear boy, let me again remind you that you are in a manner answerable to
      the nation for your actions; and especially to that particular section of
      the nation called Society. Society is the least and worst part of the
      whole community&mdash;but it has to be considered by such servants of the
      public as ourselves. You know what James the First of England wrote
      concerning the 'domestic regulations' on the conduct of a prince and
      future king? 'A king is set as one on a stage, whose smallest, actions and
      gestures all the people gazinglie do behold; and, however just in the
      discharge of his office, yet if his behaviour be light or dissolute, in
      indifferent actions, the people, who see but the outward part, conceive
      preoccupied conceits of the king's inward intention, which although with
      time, the trier of all truth, will evanish by the evidence of the
      contrarie effect, yet, <i>interim patitur justus</i>, and prejudged
      conceits will, in the meantime, breed contempt, the mother of rebellion
      and disorder.' Poor James of the 'goggle eyes and large hysterical heart'
      as Carlyle describes him! Do you not agree with his estimate of a royal
      position?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am not aware, Sir, that my behaviour can as yet be called light or
      dissolute;" replied the Prince coldly, with a touch of hauteur.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do not call it so, Humphry"&mdash;said the King&mdash;"To the best of
      my knowledge, your conduct has always been most exemplary. But with all
      your excessive decorum, you are mysterious. That is bad! Society will not
      endure being kept in the dark, or outside the door of things, like a bad
      child! It wants to be in the room, and know everything and everybody. And
      this reminds me of another point on which the good English James offers
      sound advice. 'Remember to be plaine and sensible in your language; for
      besides, it is the tongue's office to be the messenger of the mind, it may
      be thought a point of imbecilitie of spirit, in a king to speak obscurely,
      much more untrewly, as if he stood in awe of any in uttering his
      thoughts.' That is precisely your mood at the present moment, Humphry,&mdash;you
      stand 'in awe'&mdash;of me or of someone else,&mdash;in 'uttering your
      thoughts.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pardon me, Sir,&mdash;I do not stand in awe of you or of anyone;" said
      the Prince composedly&mdash;"I simply do not choose to 'utter my thoughts'
      just now."
    </p>
    <p>
      The King looked at him in surprise, and with a touch of admiration. The
      defiant air he had unconsciously assumed became him,&mdash;his handsome
      face was pale, and his dark eyes coldly brilliant, like those of his
      beautiful mother, with the steel light of an inflexible resolve.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You do not choose?" said the King, after a pause&mdash;"You decline to
      give any explanation of your long hours of absence?&mdash;your constant
      visits to The Islands, and your neglect of those social duties which
      should keep you at Court?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I decline to do so for the present," replied the young man decisively; "I
      can see no harm in my preference for quietness rather than noise,&mdash;for
      scenes of nature rather than those of artificial folly. The Islands are
      but two hours sail from this port,&mdash;little tufts of land set in the
      sea, where the coral-fishers dwell. They are beautiful in their natural
      adornment of foliage and flower;&mdash;I go there to read&mdash;to dream&mdash;to
      think of life as a better, purer thing than what you call 'society' would
      make it for me; you cannot blame me for this?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The King was silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If it is your wish,"&mdash;went on the Prince&mdash;"that I should stay
      in the palace more, I will obey you. If you desire me to be seen oftener
      in the capital, I will endeavour to fulfil your command, though the
      streets stifle me. But, for God's sake, do not make me a puppet on show
      before my time,&mdash;or marry me to a woman I hate, merely for the sake
      of heirs to a wretched Throne!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The King rose from his chair, and, walking towards the garden, threw the
      rest of his cigar out among the foliage, where the burning morsel shone
      like a stray glowworm in the green. Then he turned towards his son;&mdash;his
      face was grave, almost stern.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You can go, Humphry!" he said;&mdash;"I have no more to say to you at
      present. You talk wildly and at random, as if you were, by some means or
      other, voluntarily bent upon unfitting yourself for the position you are
      destined to occupy. You will do well, I think, to remain more in evidence
      at Court. You will also do well to be seen at some of the different great
      social functions of the day. But I shall not coerce you. Only&mdash;consider
      well what I have said!&mdash;and if you have a secret"&mdash;he paused,
      and then repeated with emphasis&mdash;"I say, if you have a secret of any
      kind, be advised, and confide in me before it is too late! Otherwise you
      may find yourself betrayed unawares! Good-night!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He walked away without throwing so much as a backward glance at the
      Prince, who stood amazed at the suddenness and decision with which he had
      brought the conversation to a close; and it was not till his tall figure
      had disappeared that the young man began to realize the doubtful
      awkwardness of the attitude he had assumed towards one who, both as parent
      and king, had the most urgent claim in the world upon his respect and
      obedience. Impatient and angry with himself, he crossed the loggia and
      went out into the garden beyond. A young moon, slender as a bent willow
      wand, gleamed in the clear heavens among hosts of stars more brilliantly
      visible than itself, and the soft air, laden with the perfume of thousands
      of flowers, cooled his brain and calmed his nerves. The musical low murmur
      of the sea, lapping against the shore below the palace walls, suggested a
      whole train of pleasing and poetical fancies, and he strolled along the
      dewy grass paths, under tangles of scented shrubs and arching boughs of
      pine, giving himself up to such idyllic dreams of life and life's fairest
      possibilities, as only youthful and imaginative souls can indulge in. He
      was troubled and vexed by his father's warning, but not sufficiently to
      pay serious heed to it. His 'secret' was safe so far;&mdash;and all he had
      to do, so he considered, was to exercise a little extra precaution.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is only Von Glauben,"&mdash;he thought, "and he would never betray
      me. Besides it is a mere question of another year&mdash;and then I can
      make all the truth known."
    </p>
    <p>
      The lovely long-drawn warble of a nightingale broke the stillness around
      him with a divine persistence of passion. He listened, standing
      motionless, his eyes lifted towards the dark boughs above him, from whence
      the golden notes dropped liquidly; and his heart beat quickly as he
      thought of a voice sweeter than that of any heavenly-gifted bird, a face
      fairer than that of the fabled goddess who on such a night as this
      descended from her silver moon-car to enchant Endymion;&mdash;and he
      murmured half aloud&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who would not risk a kingdom&mdash;ay! a thousand kingdoms!&mdash;for
      such happiness as I possess! It is a foolish, blind world nowadays, that
      forgets the glory of its youth,&mdash;the glow, the breath, the tenderness
      of love!&mdash;all for amassing gold and power! I will not be of such a
      world, nor with it;&mdash;I will not be like my father, the slave of pomp
      and circumstance;&mdash;I will live an unfettered life&mdash;yes!&mdash;even
      if I have to resign the throne for the sake of freedom, still I will be
      free!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He strolled on, absorbed in romantic reverie, and the nightingale's song
      followed him through the winding woods down to the shore, where the waves
      made other music of their own, which harmonised with the dreamy fancies of
      his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, the King had sought his consort in her own apartments. Walking
      down the great corridor which led to these, the most beautiful rooms in
      the palace, he became aware of the silvery sound of stringed instruments
      mingling with harmonious voices,&mdash;though he scarcely heeded the soft
      rush of melody which came thus wafted to his ears. He was full of thoughts
      and schemes,&mdash;his son's refusal to confide in him had not seriously
      troubled him, because he knew he should, with patience, find out in good
      time all that the young Prince had declined to explain,&mdash;and his
      immediate interest was centred in his own immediate plans.
    </p>
    <p>
      On reaching the ante-room leading to the Queen's presence-chamber, he was
      informed that her Majesty was listening to a concert in the rosery.
      Thither he went unattended,&mdash;and passing through a long suite of
      splendid rooms, each one more sumptuously adorned than the last, he
      presently stepped out on the velvet greensward of one of the most perfect
      rose gardens in the world&mdash;a garden walled entirely round with tall
      hedges of the clambering flowers which gave it its name, and which were
      trailed up on all sides, so as to form a ceiling or hanging canopy above.
      In the centre of this floral hall, now in full blossom, a fountain tossed
      up one tall column of silver spray; and at its upper end, against a
      background of the dainty white roses called "Felicité perpétuelle" sat the
      Queen, in a high chair of carved ivory, surrounded by her ladies.
      Delicious music, performed by players and singers who were hidden behind
      the trees, floated in voluptuous strains upon the air, and the King,
      looking at the exquisite grouping of fair women and flowers, lit by the
      coloured lamps which gleamed here and there among the thick foliage,
      wondered to himself how it chanced, that amid surroundings which were
      calculated to move the senses to the most refined and delicate rapture, he
      himself could feel no quickening pulse, no touch of admiration. These
      open-air renderings of music and song were the Queen's favourite form of
      recreation;&mdash;at such times alone would her proud face soften and her
      eyes grow languid with an unrevealed weight of dreams. But should her
      husband, or any one of his sex break in upon the charmed circle, her
      pleasure was at once clouded,&mdash;and the cold hauteur of her beautiful
      features became again inflexibly frozen. Such was the case now, when
      perceiving the King, she waved her hand as a sign for the music to cease;
      and with a glance of something like wonderment at his intrusion, saluted
      him profoundly as he entered the precincts of her garden Court. But for
      once he did not pause as usual, on his way to where she sat,&mdash;but
      lightly acknowledging the deep curtseys of the ladies in attendance, he
      advanced towards her and raising her hand in courtly homage to his lips,
      seated himself carelessly in a low chair at her feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let the music go on!" he said; "I am here to listen."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Queen looked at him,&mdash;he met her eyes with an expression that she
      had never seen on his face before.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Suffer me to have my way!" he said to her in a low tone&mdash;"Let your
      singers finish their programme; afterwards do me the favour to dismiss
      your women, for I must speak with you alone."
    </p>
    <p>
      She bent her head in acquiescence; and re-seated herself on her ivory
      throne. The sign was given for the continuance of the music, and the King,
      leaning back in his chair, half closed his eyes as he listened dreamily to
      the harmonious throbbing of harps and violins around him, in the stillness
      of the languid southern night. His hand almost brushed against his wife's
      jewelled robes&mdash;the scent of the great lilies on her breast was
      wafted to him with every breath of air, and he thought&mdash;"All this
      would be Paradise,&mdash;with any other woman!" And while he so thought,
      the clear tenor voice of one of the unseen singers rang out in half gay,
      half tender tones:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  If I loved you, and you loved me,
  How happy this little world would be&mdash;
  The light of the day, the dancing hours,
  The skies, the trees, the birds and flowers,
  Would all be part of our perfect gladness;&mdash;
  And never a note of pain or sadness
  Would jar life's beautiful melody
  If I loved you, and you loved me!

  'If I loved you!' Why, I scarcely know
  How if I did, the time would go!&mdash;
  I should forget my dreary cares,
  My sordid toil, my long despairs,
  I should watch your smile, and kneel at your feet,
  And live my life in the love of you, Sweet!&mdash;
  So mad, so glad, so proud I should be,
  If I loved you, and you loved me!

  'If you loved me!' Ah, nothing so strange
  As that could chance in this world of change!&mdash;
  As well expect a planet to fall,
  Or a Queen to dwell in a beggar's hall&mdash;
  But if you did,&mdash;romance and glory
  Might spring from our lives' united story,
  And angels might be less happy than we&mdash;
  If I loved you and you loved me!

  'If I loved you and you loved me!'
  Alas, 't is a joy we shall never see!
  You are too fair&mdash;I am too cold;&mdash;
  We shall drift along till we both grow old,
  Till we reach the grave, and gasping, die,
  Looking back on the days that have passed us by,
  When 'what might have been,' can no longer be,&mdash;
  When I lost you, and you lost me!
</pre>
    <p>
      The song concluded abruptly, and with passion;&mdash;and the King, turning
      on his elbow, glanced with a touch of curiosity at the face of his Queen.
      There was not a flicker of emotion on its fair cold calmness,&mdash;not a
      quiver on the beautiful lips, or a sigh to stir the quiet breast on which
      the lilies rested, white and waxen, and heavily odorous. He withdrew his
      gaze with a half smile at his own folly for imagining that she could be
      moved by a mere song to any expression of feeling,&mdash;even for a
      moment,&mdash;and allowed his glance to wander unreservedly over the forms
      and features of the other ladies in attendance who, conscious of his
      regard, dropped their eyelids and blushed softly, after the fashion
      approved by the heroines of the melodramatic stage. Whereat he began to
      think of the tiresome sameness of women generally; and their irritating
      habit of living always at two extremes,&mdash;either all ardour, or all
      coldness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Both are equally fatiguing to a man's mind," he thought impatiently&mdash;"The
      only woman that is truly fascinating is the one who is never in the same
      mind two days together. Fair on Monday, plain on Tuesday, sweet on
      Wednesday, sour on Thursday, tender on Friday, cold on Saturday, and in
      all moods at once on Sunday,&mdash;that being a day of rest! I should
      adore such a woman as that if I ever met her, because I should never know
      her mind towards me!"
    </p>
    <p>
      A soft serenade rendered by violins, with a harp accompaniment, was
      followed by a gay mazurka, played by all the instruments together,&mdash;and
      this finished the musical programme.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Queen rose, accepting the hand which the King extended to her, and
      moved with him slowly across the rose-garden, her long snowy train
      glistering with jewels, and held up from the greensward by a pretty page,
      who, in his picturesque costume of rose and gold, demurely followed his
      Royal lady's footsteps,&mdash;and so amid the curtseying ladies-in-waiting
      and other attendants, they passed together into a private boudoir, at the
      threshold of which the Queen's train-bearer dropped his rich burden of
      perfumed velvet and gems, and bowing low, left their Majesties together.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shutting the door upon him with his own hand, the King drew a heavy
      portière across it,&mdash;and then walking round the room saw that every
      window was closed,&mdash;every nook secure. The Queen's boudoir was one of
      the most sacred corners in the whole palace,&mdash;no one, not even the
      most intimate lady of the Court in personal attendance on her Majesty,
      dared enter it without special permission; and this being the case, the
      Queen herself was faintly moved to surprise at the extra precaution her
      husband appeared to be taking to ensure privacy. She stood silently
      watching his movements till he came up to her, and bowing courteously,
      said:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "I pray you, be seated, Madam! I will not detain you long."
    </p>
    <p>
      She obeyed his gesture, and sank down in a chair with that inimitable
      noiseless grace which made every attitude of hers a study for an artist,
      and waited for his next words; while he, standing opposite to her, bent
      his eyes upon her face with a certain wistfulness and appeal.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have never asked you a favour," he began&mdash;"and&mdash;since the day
      we married,&mdash;I have never sought your sympathy. The years have come
      and gone, leaving no visible trace on either you or me, so far as outward
      looks go,&mdash;and if they have scarred and wrinkled us inwardly, only
      God can see those scars! But as time moves on with a man,&mdash;I know not
      how it is with a woman,&mdash;if he be not altogether a fool, he begins to
      consider the way in which he has spent, or is spending his life,&mdash;whether
      he has been, or is yet likely to be of any use to the world he lives in,&mdash;or
      if he is of less account than the blown froth of the sea, or the sand on
      the shore. Myriads and myriads of men and women are no more than this&mdash;no
      more than midges or ants or worms;&mdash;but every now and then in the
      course of centuries, one man does stand forth from the million,&mdash;one
      heart does beat courageously enough to send the firm echo of its
      pulsations through a long vista of time,&mdash;one soul does so exalt and
      inspire the rest of the world by its great example that we are, through
      its force reminded of something divine,&mdash;something high and true in a
      low wilderness of shams!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He paused; the Queen raised her beautiful eyes, and smiled strangely.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you only just now thought of this?" she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      He flushed, and bit his lip.
    </p>
    <p>
      "To be perfectly honest with you, Madam, I have thought of nothing worth
      thinking about for many years! Most men in my position would probably make
      the same confession. Perhaps had you given me any great work to do for
      your sake I should have done it! Had <i>you</i> inspired me to achieve
      some great conquest, either for myself or others, I should no doubt have
      conquered! But I have lived for twenty-one years in your admirable company
      without being commanded by you to do anything worthy of a king;&mdash;I am
      now about to command Myself!&mdash;in order to leave some notable trace of
      my name in history."
    </p>
    <p>
      While he thus spoke, a faint flush coloured the Queen's cheeks, but it
      quickly died away, leaving her very pale. Her fingers strayed among the
      great jewels she wore, and toyed unconsciously with a ruby talisman cut in
      the shape of a heart, and encircled with diamonds. The King noted the
      flash of the gems against the whiteness of her hand, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your heart, Madam, is like the jewel you hold!&mdash;clear crimson, and
      full of fire,&mdash;but it is not the fire of Heaven, though you may
      perchance judge it to be so. Rather is it of hell!&mdash;(I pray you to
      pardon me for the roughness of this suggestion!)&mdash;for one of the
      chief crimes of the devil is unconquerable hatred of the human race. You
      share Satan's aversion to man!&mdash;and strange indeed it is that even
      the most sympathetic companionship with your own sex cannot soften that
      aversion! However, we will not go into this;&mdash;the years have proved
      you true to your own temperament, and there is nothing to be said on the
      matter, either of blame or of praise. As I said, I have never asked a
      favour of you, nor have I sought the sympathy which it is not in your
      nature to give. I have not even claimed your obedience in any particular
      strictness of form; but that is my errand to you to-night,&mdash;indeed it
      is the sole object of this private interview,&mdash;to claim your entire,
      your unfaltering, your implicit obedience!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She raised her head haughtily.
    </p>
    <p>
      "To what commands, Sir?" she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "To those I have here written,&mdash;" and he handed her a paper folded in
      two, which she took wonderingly, as he extended it. "Read this carefully!&mdash;and
      if you have any objections to urge, I am willing to listen to you with
      patience, though scarcely to alter the conditions laid down."
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned away, and walked slowly through the room, pausing a moment to
      whistle to a tiny bird swinging in a gilded cage, that perked up its
      pretty head at his call and twittered with pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So you respond to kindness, little one!" he said softly,&mdash;"You are
      more Christ-like in that one grace than many a Christian!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He started, as a light touch fell on his shoulder, and he saw the Queen
      standing beside him. She held the paper he had given her in one hand, and
      as he looked at her enquiringly she touched it with her lips, and placed
      it in her bosom.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I swear my obedience to your instructions, Sir!" she said,&mdash;"Do not
      fear to trust me!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Gently he took her hands and kissed them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thank you!" he said simply.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a moment they confronted each other. The beautiful cold woman's eyes
      drooped under the somewhat sad and searching gaze of the man.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But&mdash;your life!&mdash;" she murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My life!" He laughed and dropped her hands. "Would you care, Madam, if I
      were dead? Would you shed any tears? Not you! Why should you? At this late
      hour of time, when after twenty-one years passed in each other's close
      company we are no nearer to each other in heart and soul than if the sea
      murmuring yonder at the foot of these walls were stretching its whole
      width between us! Besides&mdash;we are both past our youth! And, according
      to certain highly instructed scientists and philosophers, the senses and
      affections grow numb with age. I do not believe this theory myself&mdash;for
      the jejune love of youth is as a taper's flame to the great and passionate
      tenderness of maturity, when the soul, and not the body, claims its due;
      when love is not dragged down to the vulgar level of mere cohabitation,
      after the fashion of the animals in a farmyard, but rises to the best
      height of human sympathy and intelligent comprehension. Who knows!&mdash;I
      may experience such a love as that yet,&mdash;and so may you!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She was silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Talking of love,"&mdash;he went on&mdash;"May I ask whether our son,&mdash;or
      rather the nation's son, Humphry,&mdash;ever makes you his confidante?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never!" she replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thought not! We do not seem to be the kind of parents admired in moral
      story-books, Madam! We are not the revered darlings of our children. In
      fact, our children have the happy disposition of animal cubs,&mdash;once
      out of the nursing stage, they forget they ever had parents. It is quite
      the natural and proper thing, born as they were born,&mdash;it would never
      do for them to have any over-filial regard for us. Imagine Humphry weeping
      for my death, or yours! What a grotesque idea! And as for Rupert and
      Cyprian,&mdash;it is devoutly to be hoped that when we die, our funerals
      may be well over before the great cricket matches of the year come on, as
      otherwise they will curse us for having left the world at an inconvenient
      season!" He laughed. "How sentiment has gone out nowadays, or how it seems
      to have gone out! Yet it slumbers in the heart of the nation,&mdash;and if
      it should ever awaken,&mdash;well!&mdash;it will be dangerous! I asked you
      about Humphry, because I imagine he is entangled in some love-affair. If
      it should be agreeable to your humour to go with me across to The Islands
      one day this week, we may perhaps by chance discover the reason of his
      passion for that particular kind of scenery!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The Queen's eyes opened wonderingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Islands!" she repeated,&mdash;"The Islands? Why, only the
      coral-fishers live there,&mdash;they have a community of their own, and
      are jealous of all strangers. What should Humphry do there?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is more than I can tell you," answered the King,&mdash;"And it is
      more than he will himself explain. Nevertheless, he is there nearly every
      day,&mdash;some attraction draws him, but what, I cannot discover. If
      Humphry were of the soul of me, as he is of the body of me, I should not
      even try to fathom his secret,&mdash;but he is the nation's child&mdash;heir
      to its throne&mdash;and as such, it is necessary that we, for the nation's
      sake, should guard him in the nation's interests. If you chance to learn
      anything of the object of his constant sea-wanderings, I trust you will
      find it coincident with your pleasure to inform me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall most certainly obey you in this, Sir, as in all other things!"
      she replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      He moved a step or two towards her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good-night!" he said very gently, and detaching one of the lilies from
      her corsage, took it in his own hand. "Good-night! This flower will remind
      me of you;&mdash;white and beautiful, with all the central gold deep
      hidden!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at her intently, with a lingering look, half of tenderness, half
      of regret, and bowing in the courtliest fashion of homage, left her
      presence.
    </p>
    <p>
      She remained alone, the velvet folds of her train flowing about her feet,
      and the jewels on her breast flashing like faint sparks of flame in the
      subdued glow of the shaded lamplight. She was touched for the first time
      in her life by the consciousness of something infinitely noble, and
      altogether above her in her husband's nature. Slowly she drew out the
      paper he had given her from her bosom and read it through again&mdash;and
      yet once again. Almost unconsciously to herself a mist gathered in her
      eyes and softened into two bright tears, which dropped down her fair
      cheeks, and lost themselves among her diamonds.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He is brave!" she murmured&mdash;"Braver than I thought he could ever be&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      She roused herself sharply from her abstraction. Emotions which were
      beyond her own control had strangely affected her, and the humiliating
      idea that her moods had for a moment escaped beyond her guidance made her
      angry with herself for what she considered mere weakness. And passing
      quickly out of the boudoir, in the vague fear that solitude might deepen
      the sense of impotence and failure which insinuated itself slowly upon
      her, like a dull blight creeping through her heart and soul, she rejoined
      her ladies, the same great Queen as ever, with the same look of
      indifference on her face, the same chill smile, the same perfection of
      loveliness, unwithered by any visible trace of sorrow or of passion.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VI. &mdash; SERGIUS THORD
    </h2>
    <p>
      The next day the heavens were clouded; and occasional volleys of heavy
      thunder were mingled with the gusts of wind and rain which swept over the
      city, and which lashed the fair southern sea into a dark semblance of such
      angry waves as wear away northern coasts into bleak and rocky barrenness.
      It was disappointing weather to multitudes, for it was the feast-day of
      one of the numerous saints whose names fill the calendar of the Roman
      Church,&mdash;and a great religious procession had been organized to march
      from the market-place to the Cathedral, in which two or three hundred
      children and girls had been chosen to take part. The fickle bursts of
      sunshine which every now and again broke through the lowering sky, decided
      the priests to carry out their programme in spite of the threatening
      storm, in the hope that it would clear off completely with the afternoon.
      Accordingly, groups of little maidens, in white robes and veils, began to
      assemble with their flags and banners at the appointed hour round the old
      market cross, which,&mdash;grey and crumbling at the summit,&mdash;bent
      over the streets like a withered finger, crook'd as it were, in feeble
      remonstrance at the passing of time,&mdash;while glimpses of young faces
      beneath the snowy veils, and chatter of young voices, made brightness and
      music around its frowning and iron-bound base. Shortly before three
      o'clock the Cathedral bells began to chime, and crowds of people made
      their way towards the sacred edifice in the laughing, pushing,
      gesticulating fashion of southerners, to whom a special service at the
      Church is like a new comedy at the theatre,&mdash;women with coloured
      kerchiefs knotted over their hair or across their bosoms&mdash;men, more
      or less roughly clad, yet all paying compliment to the Saint's feast-day
      by some extra smart touch in their attire, if it were only a pomegranate
      flower or orange-blossom stuck in their hats, or behind their ears. It was
      a mixed crowd, all of the working classes, who are proverbially called
      'the common,' as if those who work, are not a hundred times more noble
      than those who do nothing! A few carriages, containing some wealthy ladies
      of the nobility, who, to atone for their social sins, were in the habit of
      contributing largely to the Church, passed every now and again through the
      crowd, but taken as a spectacle it was simply a 'popular' show, in which
      the children of the people took part, and where the people themselves were
      evidently more amused than edified.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the bells were ringing the procession gradually formed;&mdash;a
      dozen or more priests leading,&mdash;incense-bearers and acolytes walking
      next,&mdash;and then the long train of little children and girls carrying
      their symbolic banners, following after. The way they had to walk was a
      steep, winding ascent, through tortuous streets, to the Cathedral, which
      stood in the centre of a great square on an eminence which overlooked the
      whole city, and as soon as they started they began to sing,&mdash;softly
      at first, then more clearly and sweetly, till gradually the air grew full
      of melody, rising and falling on the capricious gusts of wind which tore
      at the gilded and emblazoned banners, and tossed the white veils of the
      maidens about like wreaths of drifting snow. Two men standing on the
      Cathedral hill, watched the procession gradually ascending&mdash;one tall
      and heavily-built, with a dark leonine head made more massive-looking by
      its profusion of thick and unmanageable hair&mdash;the other lean and
      narrow-shouldered, with a peaked reddish-auburn beard, which he
      continually pulled and twitched at nervously as though its growth on his
      chin was more a matter of vexation than convenience. He was apparently not
      so much interested in the Church festival as he was in his companion's
      face, for he was perpetually glancing up at that brooding countenance,
      which, half hidden as it was in wild hair and further concealed by thick
      moustache and beard, showed no expression at all, unless an occasional
      glimpse of full flashing eyes under the bushy brows, gave a sudden
      magnetic hint of something dangerous and not to be trifled with.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You do not believe anything you hear or read, Sergius Thord!" he said&mdash;"Will
      you twist your whole life into a crooked attitude of suspicion against all
      mankind?" He who was named Sergius Thord, lifted himself slowly from the
      shoulders upwards, the action making his great height and broad chest even
      more apparent than before. A gleam of white teeth shone under his black
      moustache.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do not twist my life into a crooked attitude, Johan Zegota," he
      replied. "If it is crooked, others have twisted it for me! Why should I
      believe what I hear, since it is the fashion to lie? Why should I accept
      what I read, since it is the business of the press to deceive the public?
      And why do you ask me foolish questions? You should be better instructed,
      seeing that your creed is the same as mine!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have I ever denied it?" exclaimed Zegota warmly&mdash;"But I have said,
      and I say again that I believe the news is true,&mdash;and that these
      howling hypocrites,&mdash;" this with an angry gesture of his hand towards
      the open square where the chanting priests who headed the procession were
      coming into view&mdash;"have truly received an unlooked-for check from the
      King!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Sergius Thord laid one hand heavily on his shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      "When the King&mdash;when any king&mdash;does anything useful in the
      world, then you may hang me with your own hands, Zegota! When did you ever
      hear, except in myths of the past, of a monarch who cared for his people
      more than his crown? Tell me that! Tell me of any king who so truly loved
      the people he was called upon to govern, that he sacrificed his own money,
      as well as his own time, to remedy their wrongs?&mdash;to save them from
      unjust government, to defend them from cruel taxation?&mdash;to see that
      their bread was not taken from their mouths by foreign competition?&mdash;and
      to make it possible for them to live in the country of their birth in
      peace and prosperity? Bah! There never was such a king! And that this man,&mdash;who
      has for three years left us to the mercy of the most accursed cheat and
      scoundrel minister that ever was in power,&mdash;has now declared his
      opposition to the Jesuits', is more than I will or can believe."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If it were true?"&mdash;suggested Zegota, with a more than usually
      vicious tug at his beard.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If it were true, it would not alter my opinion, or set aside my
      intention," replied Thord,&mdash;"I would admit that the King had done one
      good deed before going to hell! Look! Here come the future traitresses of
      men&mdash;girls trained by priests to deceive their nearest and dearest!
      Poor children! They know nothing as yet of the uses to which their lives
      are destined! If they could but die now, in their innocent faith and
      stupidity, how much better for all the world!"
    </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke, the wind, swooping into the square, and accompanied by a
      pattering gust of rain, fell like a fury upon the leaders of the religious
      procession and tore one of the great banners out of the hands of the
      priest who held it, beating it against his head and face with so much
      force that he fell backward to the ground under its weight, while from a
      black cloud above, a flash of lightning gleamed, followed almost
      instantaneously by a loud clap of thunder, which shook the square with a
      mighty reverberation like that of a bursting bomb. The children screamed,&mdash;and
      ran towards the Cathedral pellmell; and for a few moments there ensued
      indescribable confusion, the priests, the people, and the white-veiled
      girls getting mixed together in a wild hurly-burly. Sergius Thord suddenly
      left his companion's side, and springing on a small handcart that stood
      empty near the centre of the square, his tall figure rose up all at once
      like a dark apparition above the heads of the assembled crowd, and his
      voice, strong, clear, and vibrating with passion, rang out like a deep
      alarm bell, through all the noise of the storm.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Whither are you going, O foolish people? To pray to God? Pray to Him
      here, then, under the flash of His lightning!&mdash;in the roll of His
      thunder!&mdash;beneath His cathedral-canopy of clouds! Pray to Him with
      all your hearts, your brains, your reason, your intelligence, and leave
      mere lip-service and mockery to priests; and to these poor children, who,
      as yet, know no better than to obey tyrants! Would you find out God? He is
      here&mdash;with me,&mdash;with you!&mdash;in the earth, in the sky, in the
      sun and storm! Whenever Truth declares a living fact, God speaks,&mdash;whenever
      we respond to that Truth, God hears! No church, no cathedral contains His
      presence more than we shall find it here&mdash;with us&mdash;where we
      stand!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The people heard, and a great silence fell upon them. All faces were
      turned toward the speaker, and none appeared to heed the great drops of
      fast-falling rain. One of the priests who was trying to marshal the
      scattered children into their former order, so that they might enter the
      Cathedral in the manner arranged for the religious service, looked up to
      see the cause of the sudden stillness, and muttered a curse under his
      breath. But even while the oath escaped his lips, he gave the signal for
      the sacred chanting to be resumed, and in another moment the 'Litany of
      the Virgin' was started in stentorian tones by the leaders of the
      procession. Intimidated by the looks, as well as by the commands of the
      priests, the girls and children joined in the chanting with tremulous
      voices, as they began to file through the Cathedral doors and enter the
      great nave. But a magnetic spell, stronger than any invocation of the
      Church, had fallen upon the crowd, and they all stood as though caught in
      the invisible web of some enchanter, their faces turned upwards to where
      Thord's tall figure towered above them. His eyes glittered as he noted the
      sudden hush of attention which prevailed, and lifting his rough cap from
      his head, he waved it towards the open door of the Cathedral, through
      which the grand strains of the organ rolling out from within gave forth
      solemn invitation:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sancta Dei Genitrix, Ora pro nobis!"
    </p>
    <p>
      sang the children, as they passed in line under the ancient porch, carved
      with the figures of forgotten saints and bishops, whose stone countenances
      had stared at similar scenes through the course of long centuries.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sancta Dei Genitrix, ora pro nobis!" echoed Sergius Thord&mdash;"Do you
      hear it, O men? Do you hear it, O women? What does it teach you? 'Holy
      Mother of God!' Who was she? Was she not merely a woman to whom God
      descended? And what is the lesson she gives you? Plainly this&mdash;that
      men should be as gods, and women as the mothers of gods! For every true
      and brave man born into the world has God within him,&mdash;is made of
      God, and must return to God! And every woman who gives birth to one such,
      true, brave man, has given a God-incarnated being to the world! 'Sancta
      Dei Genitrix!' Be all as mothers of gods, O women! Be as gods, O men! Be
      as gods in courage, in truth, in wisdom, in freedom! Suffer not devils to
      have command of you! For devils there are, as there are gods;&mdash;evil
      there is, as there is good. Fiends are born of women as gods are&mdash;and
      yet evil itself is of God, inasmuch as without God there can be neither
      evil nor good. Let us help God, we His children, to conquer evil by
      conquering it in ourselves&mdash;and by refusing to give it power over us!
      So shall God show us all goodness,&mdash;all pity! So shall He cease to
      afflict His children; so will He cease to torture us with undeserved
      sorrows and devilish agonies, for which we are not to blame!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He paused. The singing had ceased; the children's procession had entered
      the Cathedral, and the doors still stood wide open. But the people
      remained outside, crowded in the square, and gathering momentarily in
      greater numbers.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Look you!" cried Sergius Thord&mdash;"The building which is called the
      Sanctuary of God, stands open&mdash;why do you not all enter there? Within
      are precious marbles, priceless pictures, jewels and relics&mdash;and a
      great altar raised up by the gifts of wicked dead kings, who by money
      sought to atone for their sins to the people. There are priests who fast
      and pray in public, and gratify all the lusts of appetite in private.
      There are poor and ignorant women who believe whatsoever these priests
      tell them&mdash;all this you can see if you go inside yonder. Why do you
      not go? Why do you remain with me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      A faint murmur, like the rising ripple of an angry sea, rose from the
      crowd, but quickly died away again into silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Shall I tell you why you stay?" went on Thord,&mdash;"Because you know I
      am your friend&mdash;and because you also know that the priests are your
      enemies! Because you know that I tell you the truth, and that the priests
      tell you lies! Because you feel that all the promises made to you of
      happiness in Heaven cannot explain away to your satisfaction the causes of
      your bitter suffering and poverty on earth! Because you are gradually
      learning that the chief business of priestcraft is to deceive the people
      and keep them down,&mdash;down, always down in a state of wretched
      ignorance. Learn, learn all you can, my brothers&mdash;take the only good
      thing modern government gives you&mdash;Education! Education is thrown at
      us like a bone thrown to a dog, half picked by others and barely
      nourishing&mdash;but take it, take it, friends, for in it you shall find
      the marrow of vengeance on your tyrants and oppressors! The education of
      the masses means the downfall of false creeds,&mdash;the ruin of all false
      priests! For it is only through the ignorance of the many that tyrannical
      dominion is given into the hands of the few! Slavish submission to a
      corrupt government would be impossible if we all refused to be slaves. O
      friends, O brothers, throw off your chains! Break down your prison doors!
      Some good you have done already&mdash;be brave and strong to do more!
      Press forward fearlessly and strive for liberty and justice! To-day we are
      told that the King has refused crown-lands to the Jesuits. Shall we be
      told to-morrow that the King has dismissed Carl Pérousse from office?"
    </p>
    <p>
      A long wild shout told how this suggestion had gone straight home to the
      throng.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Shall we be told this, I ask? No! Ten thousand times no! The refusal of
      the King to grant the priests any wider dominion over us is merely an act
      of policy inspired by terror. The King is afraid! He fears the people will
      revolt against the Church, and so takes part with them lest there should
      be trouble in the land, but he never seems to think there may be another
      kind of revolt against himself! His refusal to concede more place for the
      accursed practice of Jesuitry is so far good; but his dismissal of
      Pérousse would be still better!"
    </p>
    <p>
      A perfect hurricane of applause from the people gave emphatic testimony to
      the truth of these words.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is this man, Carl Pérousse?" he went on&mdash;"A man of the people&mdash;whose
      oaths were sworn to the people,&mdash;whom the people themselves brought
      into power because he promised to remain faithful to them! He is false,&mdash;a
      traitor and political coward! A mere manufacturer of kitchen goods, who
      through our folly was returned to this country's senate;&mdash;and through
      our still further credulity is now set in almost complete dominion over
      us. Well! We have suffered and are suffering for our misplaced belief in
      him;&mdash;the question is, how long shall we continue to suffer? How long
      are we to be governed by the schemes of Carl Pérousse, the country's
      turncoat,&mdash;the trafficker in secret with Jew speculators? It is for
      you to decide! It is for you to work out your own salvation! It is for you
      to throw off tyranny, and show yourselves free men of reason and capacity!
      Just as the priests chant long prayers to cover their own iniquity, so do
      the men of government make long speeches to disguise their own corruption.
      You know you cannot believe their promises. Neither can you believe the
      press, for if this is not actually bought by Pérousse, it is bribed. And
      you cannot trust the King; for he is as a house divided against itself
      which must fall! Slave of his own passions, and duped by women, what is he
      but a burden to the State? Justice and power should be on the side of
      kings,&mdash;but the days are come when self-interest and money can even
      buy a throne! O men, O women, rouse up your hearts and minds to work for
      yourselves, to redress wrongs,&mdash;to save your country! Rouse up in
      your thousands, and with your toil-worn hands pull down the pillars of
      iniquity and vice that overshadow and darken the land! Fight against the
      insolent pride of wealth which strives to crush the poor; rouse, rouse
      your hearts!&mdash;open your eyes and see the evils which are gathering
      thick upon us!&mdash;and like the lightnings pent up in yonder clouds,
      leap forth in flame and thunder, and clear the air!"
    </p>
    <p>
      A burst of frantic acclamation from the crowd followed this wild harangue,
      and while the loud roar of voices yet echoed aloft, a band of armed police
      came into view, marching steadily up from the lower streets of the city.
      Sergius Thord smiled as he saw them approach.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yonder comes the Law!" he said&mdash;"A few poor constables, badly paid,
      who if they could find anything better to do than to interfere with their
      fellow-men would be glad of other occupation! Before they come any nearer,
      disperse yourselves, my friends, and so save them trouble! Go all to your
      homes and think on my words;&mdash;or enter the Cathedral and pray, those
      who will&mdash;but let this place be as empty of you in five minutes as
      though you never had been here! Disperse,&mdash;and farewell! We shall
      meet again!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He leaped down from his position and disappeared, and in obedience to his
      command the crowd began to melt away with almost miraculous speed. Before
      the police could reach the centre of the square, there were only some
      thirty or forty people left, and these were quietly entering the Cathedral
      where the service for the saint whose feast day was being celebrated was
      now in full and solemn progress.
    </p>
    <p>
      For one instant, on the first step of the great porch, Sergius Thord and
      his companion, Johan Zegota, met,&mdash;but making a rapid sign to each
      other with the left hand, they as quickly separated,&mdash;Zegota to enter
      the Cathedral, Thord to walk rapidly down one of the narrowest and most
      unfrequented streets to the lower precincts of the city.
    </p>
    <p>
      The afternoon grew darker, and the weather more depressing, and by the
      time evening closed in, the rain was pouring persistently. The wind had
      ceased, and the thunder had long since died away, its force drenched out
      by the weight of water in the clouds. The saint's day had ended badly for
      all concerned;&mdash;many of the children who had taken part in the
      procession had been carried home by their parents wet through, all the
      pretty white frocks and veils of the little girls having been completely
      soaked and spoilt by the unkind elements. A drearier night had seldom
      gloomed over this fair city of the southern sea, and down in the quarters
      of the poor, where men and women dwelt all huddled miserably in
      overcrowded tenements, and sin and starvation kept hideous company
      together, the streets presented as dark and forbidding an aspect as the
      heavy skies blackly brooding above. Here and there a gas-lamp flared its
      light upon the drawn little face of some child crouching asleep in a
      doorway, or on the pinched and painted features of some wretched outcast
      wending her way to the den she called 'home.' The loud brutal laughter of
      drunken men was mingled with the wailing of half-starved and fretful
      infants, and the mean, squalid houses swarmed with the living spawn of
      every vice and lust in the calendar of crime. Deep in the heart of the
      so-called civilized, beautiful and luxurious city, this 'quarter of the
      poor,' the cancer of the social body, throbbed and ate its destructive way
      slowly but surely on, and Sergius Thord, who longed to lay a sharp knife
      against it and cut it out, for the health of the whole community, was as
      powerless as Dante in hell to cure the evils he witnessed. Yet it was not
      too much to say that he would have given his life to ease another's pain,&mdash;as
      swiftly and as readily as he would have taken life without mercy, in the
      pursuit of what he imagined to be a just vengeance.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How vain, after all, is my labour!" he thought&mdash;"How helpless I am
      to move the self-centred powers of the Government and the Throne! Even
      were all these wretched multitudes to rise with me, and make havoc of the
      whole city, should we move so much as one step higher out of the Gehenna
      of poverty and crime? Almost I doubt it!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He walked on past dark open doorways, where some of the miserable
      inhabitants of the dens within, stood to inhale the fresh wet air of the
      rainy night. His tall form was familiar to most of them,&mdash;if they
      were considered as wolves of humanity in the sight of the law, they were
      all faithful dogs to him; doing as he bade, running where he commanded,
      ready at any moment to assemble at any given point and burn and pillage,
      or rob and slay. There were no leaders in the political government,&mdash;but
      this one leader of the massed poor could, had he chosen, have burned down
      the city. But he did not choose. He had a far-sighted, clear brain,&mdash;and
      though he had sworn to destroy abuses wherever he could find them, he
      moved always with caution; and his plans were guided, not by impulse
      alone, but by earnest consideration for the future. He was marked out by
      the police as a dangerous Socialist; and his movements were constantly
      tracked and dodged, but so far, he had done nothing which could empower
      his arrest. He was a free subject in a free country; and provided he
      created no open disturbance he had as much liberty as a mission preacher
      to speak in the streets to those who would stop to listen. He paused now
      in his walk at the door of one house more than commonly dingy and
      tumble-down in appearance, where a man lounged outside in his
      shirt-sleeves, smoking.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is all well with you, Matsin?" he asked gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      "All is well!" answered the man called Matsin,&mdash;"better than last
      night. The child is dead."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dead!" echoed Thord,&mdash;"And the mother&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Asleep!" answered Matsin. "I gave her opium to save her from madness. She
      was hungry, too&mdash;the opium fed her and made her forget!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Thord pushed him gently aside, and went into the house. There on the floor
      lay the naked body of a dead child, so emaciated as to be almost a
      skeleton; and across it, holding it close with one arm, was stretched a
      woman, half clothed, her face hidden in her unbound dark hair, breathing
      heavily in a drugged sleep. Great tears filled Thord's eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "God exists!" he said,&mdash;"And He can bear to look upon a sight like
      this! If I were God, I should hate myself for letting such things be!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps He does hate Himself!" said the man Matsin, who had also come in,
      and now looked at the scene with sullen apathy&mdash;"That may be the
      cause of all our troubles! I don't understand the ways of God; or the ways
      of man either. I have done no harm. I married the woman&mdash;and we had
      that one child. I worked hard for both. I could not get sufficient money
      to keep us going; I did metal work&mdash;very well, so I was told. But
      they make it all abroad now by machinery&mdash;I cannot compete. They
      don't want new designs they say&mdash;the old will serve. I do anything
      now that I can&mdash;but it is difficult. You, too,&mdash;you starve with
      us!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am poor, if that is what you mean," said Thord,&mdash;"but take all I
      have to-night, Matsin&mdash;" and he emptied a small purse of silver coins
      into the man's hand. "Bury the poor little innocent one;&mdash;and comfort
      the mother when she wakes. Comfort her!&mdash;love her!&mdash;she needs
      love! I will be back again to-morrow."
    </p>
    <p>
      He strode away quickly, and Matsin remained at his door turning over the
      money in his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He will sacrifice something he needs himself, for this," he muttered.
      "Yet that is the man they say the King would hang if ever he got hold of
      him! By Heaven!&mdash;the King himself should hang first!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile Sergius Thord went on, slackening his pace a little as he came
      near his own destination, a tall and narrow house at the end of the
      street, with a single light shining in one of the upper windows. There was
      a gas-lamp some few paces off, and under this stood a man reading, or
      trying to read, a newspaper by its flickering glare. Thord glanced at him
      with some suspicion&mdash;the stranger was too near his own lodging for
      his pleasure, for he was always on his guard against spies. Approaching
      more closely, he saw that though the man was shabbily attired in a rough
      pilot suit, much the worse for wear, he nevertheless had the indefinable
      look and bearing of a gentleman. Acting on impulse, as he often did, Thord
      spoke to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A rough night for reading by lamplight, my friend!" he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man looked up, and smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, it is, rather! But I have only just got the evening paper."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Any special news?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No&mdash;only this&mdash;" and he pointed to a bold headline&mdash;"The
      King <i>versus</i> The Jesuits."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah!" said Thord, and he studied the looks and bearing of the stranger
      with increasing curiosity. "What do you think of it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do I think? May I ask, without offence, what <i>you</i> think?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think," said Thord slowly, "that the King has for once in his life done
      a wise thing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "'For once in his life!'" repeated the stranger dubiously&mdash;"Then I
      presume your King is, generally speaking, a fool?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you are a subject of his&mdash;" began Thord slowly&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank Heaven, I am not! I am a mere wanderer&mdash;a literary loafer&mdash;a
      student of men and manners. I read books, and I write them too,&mdash;this
      will perhaps explain the eccentricity of my behaviour in trying to read
      under the lamplight in the rain!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He smiled again, and the smile was irresistibly pleasant. Something about
      him attracted Thord, and after a pause he asked:
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you are, as you say, a wanderer and a stranger in this town, can I be
      of service to you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are very kind!" said the other, turning a pair of deep, dark, grey
      meditative eyes upon him,&mdash;"And I am infinitely obliged to you for
      the suggestion. But I really want nothing. As a matter of fact, I am
      waiting for two friends of mine who have just gone into one of the foul
      and filthy habitations here, to see what they can do for a suddenly
      bereaved family. The husband and father fell dead in the street before our
      eyes,&mdash;and those who picked him up said he was drunk, but it turned
      out that he was merely starved,&mdash;<i>merely</i>!&mdash;you understand?
      Merely starved! We found his home,&mdash;and the poor widow is wailing and
      weeping, and the children are crying for food. I confess myself quite
      unable to bear the sight, and so I have sent all the money I had about me
      to help them for to-night at least. By my faith, they are most hopelessly,
      incurably miserable!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Their lot is exceedingly common in these quarters," said Thord,
      sorrowfully. "Day after day, night after night, men, women and children
      toil, suffer and die here without ever knowing what it is to have one hour
      of free fresh air, one day of rest and joy! Yet this is a great city,&mdash;and
      we live in a civilized country!" He smiled bitterly, then added&mdash;"You
      have done a good action; and you need no thanks, or I would thank you; for
      my life's work lies among these wretched poor, and I am familiar with
      their tragic histories. Good-night!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pray do not go!" said the stranger suddenly&mdash;"I should like to talk
      to you a little longer, if you have no objection. Is there not some place
      near, where we can go out of this rain and have a glass of wine together?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Sergius Thord stood irresolute,&mdash;gazing at him, half in liking, half
      in distrust.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sir," he said at last, "I do not know you&mdash;and you do not know me.
      If I told you my name, you would probably not seek my company!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will you tell it?" suggested the stranger cheerfully&mdash;"Mine is at
      your service&mdash;Pasquin Leroy. I fear my fame as an author has not
      reached your ears!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Thord shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No. I have never heard of you. And probably you have never heard of me.
      My name is Sergius Thord."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sergius Thord!" echoed the stranger; "Now that is truly remarkable! It is
      a happy coincidence that we should have met to-night. I have just seen
      your name in this very paper which you caught me reading&mdash;see!&mdash;the
      next heading under that concerning the King and the Jesuits&mdash;'Thord's
      Rabble.' Are not you that same Thord?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am!" said Thord proudly, his eyes shining as he took the paper and
      perused quickly the few flashy lines which described the crowd outside the
      Cathedral that afternoon, and set him down as a crazy Socialist, and
      disturber of the peace, "And the 'rabble' as this scribbling fool calls
      it, is the greater part of this city's population. The King may intimidate
      his Court; but I, Sergius Thord, with my 'rabble' can intimidate both
      Court and King!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He drew himself up to his full majestic height&mdash;a noble figure of a
      man with his fine heroic head and eagle-like glance of eye,&mdash;and he
      who had called himself Pasquin Leroy, suddenly held out his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let me see more of you, Sergius Thord!" he said,&mdash;"You are the very
      man for me! They say in this paper that you spoke to a great multitude
      outside the Cathedral this afternoon, and interfered with the religious
      procession; they also say you are the head of a Society called the
      Revolutionary Committee;&mdash;now let me work for you in some department
      of <i>that</i> business!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let you work for me?" echoed Thord astonished&mdash;"But how?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "In this way&mdash;" replied the other&mdash;"I write Socialistic works,&mdash;and
      for this cause have been expelled from my native home and surroundings. I
      have a little money&mdash;and some influence,&mdash;and I will devote both
      to your Cause. Will you take me, and trust me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Thord caught his extended hand, and looked at him with a kind of fierce
      intentness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You mean it?" he said in thrilling tones&mdash;"You mean it positively
      and truly?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Positively and truly!" said Leroy&mdash;"If you are working to remedy the
      frightful evils abounding in this wretched quarter of the poor, I will
      help you! If you are striving to destroy rank abuses, I ask nothing better
      than to employ my pen in your service. I will get work on the press here&mdash;I
      will do all I can to aid your purposes and carry out your intentions. I
      have no master, so am free to do as I like; and I will devote myself to
      your service so long as you think I can be of any use to you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wait!" said Thord&mdash;"You must not be carried away by a sudden
      generous impulse, simply because you have witnessed one scene of the
      continual misery that is going on here daily. To belong to our Committee
      means much more than you at present realize, and involves an oath which
      you may not be willing to take! And what of the friends you spoke of?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "They will do what I do," replied Leroy&mdash;"They share my fortunes&mdash;likewise
      my opinions;&mdash;and here they come,&mdash;so they can speak for
      themselves," this, as two men emerged from a dark street on the left, and
      came full into the lamplight's flare&mdash;"Axel Regor, Max Graub&mdash;come
      hither! Fortune has singularly favoured us to-night! Let me present to you
      my friend&mdash;" and he emphasized the word, "Sergius Thord!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Both men started ever so slightly as the introduction was performed, and
      Thord looked at them with fresh touches of suspicion here and there
      lurking in his mind. But he was brave; and having once proceeded in a
      given direction was not in the habit of turning back. He therefore saluted
      both the new-comers with grave courtesy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I trust you!" he then said curtly to Leroy, "and I think you will not
      betray my trust. If you do, it will be the worse for you!"
    </p>
    <p>
      His lips parted in a slight sinister smile, and the two who were
      respectively called Axel Regor and Max Graub, exchanged anxious glances.
      But Leroy showed no sign of hesitation or alarm.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your warning is quite unnecessary, Sergius Thord," he said,&mdash;"I
      pledge you my word with my friendship&mdash;and my word is my bond! I will
      also hold myself responsible for my companions."
    </p>
    <p>
      Thord bent his head in silent recognition of this assurance.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then follow me, if such is your desire," he said&mdash;"Remember, there
      is yet time to go in another direction, and to see me no more; but if you
      once do cast in your lot with mine the tie between us is indissoluble!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He paused, as though expecting some recoil or hesitation on the part of
      those to whom he made this statement, but none came. He therefore strode
      on, and they followed, till arriving at the door of the tall, narrow
      house, where the light in the highest window gleamed like a signal, he
      opened it with a small key and entered, holding it back courteously for
      his three new companions to enter with him. They did so, and he closed the
      door. At the same moment the light was extinguished in the upper window,
      and the outside of the house became a mere wall of dense blackness in the
      driving rain.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VII. &mdash; THE IDEALISTS
    </h2>
    <p>
      Up a long uncarpeted flight of stairs, and into a large lofty room on the
      second storey, Thord led the way for his newly-found disciples to follow.
      It was very dark, and they had to feel the steps as they went, their guide
      offering neither explanation nor apology for the Cimmerian shades of
      gloom. Stumbling on hands and knees they spoke not a word; though once Max
      Graub uttered something like an oath in rough German; but a whisper from
      Leroy rebuked and silenced him, and they pursued their difficult ascent
      until, arriving at the room mentioned, they found themselves in the
      company of about fifteen to twenty men, all sitting round a table under
      two flaring billiard lamps, suspended crookedly from the ceiling. As Thord
      entered, these men all rose, and gave him an expressive sign of greeting
      with the left hand, the same kind of gesture which had passed between him
      and Zegota on the Cathedral steps in the morning. Zegota himself was one
      of their number. There was also another personage in the room who did not
      rise, and who gave no sign whatever. This was a woman, who sat in the
      embrasure of a closed and shuttered window with her back to the whole
      company. It was impossible to say whether she was young or old, plain or
      handsome, for she was enveloped in a long black cloak which draped her
      from shoulder to heel. All that could be distinguished of her was the
      white nape of her neck, and a great twist of dead gold hair. Her presence
      awakened the liveliest interest in Pasquin Leroy, who found it impossible
      to avoid nudging his companions, and whispering&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "A woman! By Heaven, this drama becomes interesting!"
    </p>
    <p>
      But Axel Regor and Max Graub were seemingly not disposed to levity, and
      they offered no response to their lighter minded comrade beyond vague
      hasty side-looks of alarm, which appeared to amuse him to an extent that
      threatened to go beyond the limits of caution. Sergius Thord, however, saw
      nothing of their interchange of glances for the moment,&mdash;he had other
      business to settle. Addressing himself at once to the men assembled, he
      said.&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Friends and brothers! I bring you three new associates! I have not sought
      them; they have sought me. On their own heads be their destinies! They
      offer their names to the Revolutionary Committee, and their services to
      our Cause!"
    </p>
    <p>
      A low murmur of approbation from the company greeted this announcement.
      Johan Zegota advanced a little in front of all the rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Every man is welcome to serve us who will serve us faithfully," he said.
      "But who are these new comrades, Sergius Thord? What are they?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That they must declare for themselves," said Thord, taking a chair at the
      head of the table which was evidently his accustomed place&mdash;"Put them
      through their examination!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He seated himself with the air of a king, his whole aspect betokening an
      authority that would not be trifled with or gainsaid.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Gott in Himmel!"
    </p>
    <p>
      This exclamation burst suddenly from the lips of the man called Max Graub.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What ails you?" said Thord, turning full upon him his glittering eyes
      that flashed ferocity from under their shaggy brows&mdash;"Are you
      afraid?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Afraid? Not I!" protested Graub&mdash;"But, gentlemen, think a moment!
      You speak of putting us&mdash;myself and my friends&mdash;through an
      examination! Why should you examine us? We are three poor adventurers&mdash;what
      can we have to tell?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Much, I should imagine!" retorted Zegota&mdash;"Adventurers are not such
      without adventures! Your white hairs testify to some experience of life."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My white hairs&mdash;<i>my</i> white hairs!" exclaimed Graub, when a
      touch from Axel Regor apparently recalled something to his mind for he
      began to laugh&mdash;"True, gentlemen! Very true! I had forgotten! I have
      had some adventures and some experiences! My good friend there, Pasquin
      Leroy, has also had adventures and experiences,&mdash;so have we all!
      Myself, I am a poor German, grown old in the service of a bad king! I have
      been kicked out of that service&mdash;Ach!&mdash;just for telling the
      truth; which is very much the end of all truth telling, is it not? Tell
      lies,&mdash;and kings will reward you and make you rich and great!&mdash;but
      tell truth, and see what the kings will give you for it! Kicks, and no
      halfpence! Pardon! I interrupt this so pleasant meeting!"
    </p>
    <p>
      All the men present looked at him curiously, but said nothing in response
      to his outburst. Johan Zegota, seating himself next to Sergius Thord,
      opened a large parchment volume that lay on the table, and taking up a pen
      addressed himself to Thord, saying&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will you ask the questions, or shall I?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You, by all means! Proceed in the usual manner."
    </p>
    <p>
      Whereupon Zegota began.&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Stand forth, comrades!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The three strangers advanced.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your names? Each one answer separately, please!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pasquin Leroy!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Axel Regor!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Max Graub!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of what nationality, Pasquin Leroy?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Leroy smiled. "Truly I claim none!" he said; "I was born a slave."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A slave!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The words were repeated in tones of astonishment round the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, yes, a slave!" repeated Leroy quietly. "You have heard of black
      slaves,&mdash;have you not heard of white ones too? There are countries
      still, where men purchase other men of their own blood and colour;&mdash;tyrannous
      governments, which force such men to work for them, chained to one
      particular place till they die. I am one of those,&mdash;though escaped
      for the present. You can ask me more of my country if you will; but a
      slave has no country save that of his master. If you care at all for my
      services, you will spare me further examination on this subject!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Zegota looked enquiringly at Thord.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We will pass that question," said the latter, in a low tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Zegota resumed&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "You, Axel Regor&mdash;are you a slave too?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Axel Regor smiled languidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No! I am what is called a free-born subject of the realm. I do what I
      like, though not always how I like, or when I like!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you, Max Graub?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "German!" said that individual firmly; "German to the backbone&mdash;Socialist
      to the soul!&mdash;and an enemy of all ruling sovereigns,&mdash;particularly
      the one that rules <i>me</i>!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Thord smiled darkly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you feel inclined to jest, Max Graub, I must warn you that jesting is
      not suited to the immediate moment."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Jesting! I never was more in earnest in my life!" declared Graub,&mdash;"Why
      have I left my native country? Merely because it is governed by Kaiser
      Wilhelm!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Thord smiled again.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The subject of nationality seems to excite all three of you," he said,
      "and though we ask you the question <i>pro forma</i>, it is not absolutely
      necessary that we should know from whence you come. We require your names,
      and your oath of fealty; but before binding yourselves, I will read you
      our laws, and the rules of membership for this society; rules to which, if
      you join us, you are expected to conform."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Suppose, for the sake of argument," said Pasquin Leroy,&mdash;"that after
      hearing the rules we found it wisest to draw back? Suppose my friends,&mdash;if
      not myself,&mdash;were disinclined to join your Society;&mdash;what would
      happen?"
    </p>
    <p>
      As he asked the question a curious silence fell upon the company, and all
      eyes were turned upon the speaker. There was a dead pause for a moment,
      and then Thord replied slowly and with emphasis:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing would happen save this,&mdash;that you would be bound by a solemn
      oath never to reveal what you had heard or seen here to-night, and that
      you would from henceforth be tracked every day and hour of your life by
      those who would take care that you kept your oath!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You see!" exclaimed Axel Regor excitedly, "There is danger&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Danger? Of what?" asked Pasquin Leroy coldly;&mdash;"Of death? Each one
      of us, and all three of us would fully merit it, if we broke our word!
      Gentlemen both!"&mdash;and he addressed his two companions, "If you fear
      any harm may come to yourselves through joining this society, pray
      withdraw while there is yet time! My own mind is made up; I intend to
      become familiar with the work of the Revolutionary Committee, and to aid
      its cause by my personal service!"
    </p>
    <p>
      A loud murmur of applause came from the company. Axel Regor and Max Graub
      glanced at Leroy, and saw in his face that his decision was unalterable.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then we will work for the Cause, also," said Max Graub resignedly. "What
      you determine upon, we shall do, shall we not, Axel?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Axel Regor gave a brief assent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sergius Thord looked at them all straightly and keenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have finally decided?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "We have!" replied Leroy. "We will enrol ourselves as your associates at
      once."
    </p>
    <p>
      Whereupon Johan Zegota rose from his place, and unlocking an iron safe
      which stood in one corner of the room, took out a roll of parchment and
      handed it to Thord, who, unfolding it, read in a clear though low voice
      the following:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "We, the Revolutionary Committee, are organized as a Brotherhood, bound by
      all the ties of life, death, and our common humanity, to destroy the
      abuses, and redress the evils, which self-seeking and tyrannous
      Governments impose upon the suffering poor.
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Firstly:</i> We bind ourselves to resist all such laws as may in any
      degree interfere with the reasonable, intellectual, and spiritual freedom
      of man or woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Secondly:</i> We swear to agitate against all forms of undue and
      excessive taxation, which, while scarcely affecting the rich, make life
      more difficult and unendurable to the poor.
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Thirdly:</i> We protest against the domination of priestcraft, and the
      secret methods which are employed by the Church to obtain undue influence
      in Governmental matters.
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Fourthly:</i> We are determined to stand firmly against the entrance
      of foreign competitors in the country's trade and business. All heads and
      ruling companies of firms employing foreigners instead of native workmen,
      are marked out by us as traitors, and are reserved for traitors'
      punishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Fifthly:</i> We are sworn to exterminate the existing worthless
      Government, and to replace it by a working body of capable and intelligent
      men, elected by the universal vote of the entire country. Such elections
      must take place freely and openly, and no secret influence shall be used
      to return any one person or party to power. Those attempting to sway
      opinion by bribery and corruption, will be named to the public, and
      exposed to disgrace and possible death.
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Sixthly:</i> We are resolved to unmask to the public the duplicity,
      treachery, and self-interested motives of the Secretary of State, Carl
      Pérousse.
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Seventhly:</i> We are sworn to bring about such changes as shall
      elevate a Republic to supreme power, and for this purpose are solemnly
      pledged to destroy the present Monarchy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "These," said Sergius Thord, "are the principal objects of our Society's
      work. There are other points to be considered, but these are sufficient
      for the present. I will now read the rules, which each member of our
      Brotherhood must follow if he would serve us faithfully."
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned over another leaf of the parchment scroll he held, and
      continued, reading very slowly and distinctly:
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Rule 1</i>.&mdash;Each member of the Revolutionary Committee shall
      swear fidelity to the Cause, and pledge himself to maintain inviolable
      secrecy on all matters connected with his membership and his work for the
      Society.
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Rule 2</i>.&mdash;No member shall track, follow, or enquire into the
      movements of any other member.
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Rule 3</i>.&mdash;Once in every month all members are expected to meet
      together at a given place, decided upon by the Chief of the Committee at
      the previous meeting, when business will be discussed, and lots drawn, to
      determine the choice of such members as may be fitted to perform such
      business.
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Rule</i> 4.&mdash;No member shall be bound to give his address, or to
      state where he travels, or when or how he goes, as in all respects save
      that of his membership he is a free man.
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Rule</i> 5.&mdash;In this same respect of his membership, he is bound
      to appear, or to otherwise report himself once a month at the meeting of
      the Committee. Should he fail to do so either by person, or by letter
      satisfactorily explaining his absence, he will be judged as a traitor, and
      dealt with accordingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Rule</i>6.&mdash;In the event of any member being selected to perform
      any deed involving personal danger or loss to himself, the rest of the
      members are pledged to shelter him from the consequences of his act, and
      to provide him with all the necessaries of life, till his escape from harm
      is ensured and his safety guaranteed."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have heard all now," said Thord, as he laid aside the parchment
      scroll; "Are you still willing to take the oath?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Entirely so!" rejoined Pasquin Leroy cheerfully; "You have but to
      administer it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Here a man, who had been sitting in a dark corner apart from the table,
      with his head buried in his hands, suddenly looked up, showing a thin,
      fine, eager face, a pair of wild eyes, and a tumbled mass of dark curly
      hair, plentifully sprinkled with grey.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah!" he cried,&mdash;"Now comes the tragic moment, when the spectators
      hold their breath, and the blue flame is turned on, and the man manages
      the lime-light so that its radiance shall fall on the face of the chief
      actor&mdash;or Actress! And the bassoons and 'cellos grumble inaudible
      nothings to the big drum! Administer the oath, Sergius Thord!"
    </p>
    <p>
      A smile went the round of the company.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you only just wakened up from sleep, Paul Zouche?" asked Zegota.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I never sleep," answered Zouche, pushing his hair back from his forehead;&mdash;"Unless
      sleep compels me, by force, to yield to its coarse and commonplace
      persuasion. To lie down in a shirt and snore the hours away! Faugh! Can
      anything be more gross or vulgar! Time flies so quickly, and life is so
      short, that I cannot afford to waste any moment in such stupid
      unconsciousness. I can drink wine, make love, and kill rascals&mdash;all
      these occupations are much more interesting than sleeping. Come, Sergius!
      Play the great trick of the evening! Administer the oath!"
    </p>
    <p>
      A frowning line puckered Thord's brows, but the expression of vexation was
      but momentary. Turning to Leroy again he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are quite ready?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quite," replied Leroy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And your friends&mdash;&mdash;?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Leroy smiled. "They are ready also!"
    </p>
    <p>
      There followed a pause. Then Thord called in a clear low tone&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lotys!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The woman sitting in the embrasure of the window rose, and turning round
      fully confronted all the men. Her black cloak falling back on either side,
      disclosed her figure robed in dead white, with a scarlet sash binding her
      waist. Her face, pale and serene, was not beautiful; yet beauty was
      suggested in every feature. Her eyes seemed to be half closed in a
      drooping indifference under the white lids, which were fringed heavily
      with dark gold lashes. A sculptor might have said, that whatever claim to
      beauty she had was contained in the proud poise of her throat, and the
      bounteous curve of her bosom, but though in a manner startled by her
      appearance, the three men who had chanced upon this night's adventure were
      singularly disappointed in it. They had somehow expected that when that
      mysterious cloaked feminine figure turned round, a vision of dazzling
      beauty would be disclosed; and at the first glance there was nothing
      whatever about this woman that seemed particularly worthy of note. She was
      not young or old&mdash;possibly between twenty-eight or thirty. She was
      not tall or short; she was merely of the usual medium height,&mdash;so
      that altogether she was one of those provoking individuals, who not seldom
      deceive the eye at first sight by those ordinary looks which veil an
      extraordinary personality.
    </p>
    <p>
      She stood like an automatic figure, rigid and silent,&mdash;till Sergius
      Thord signed to his three new associates to advance. Then with a movement,
      rapid as a flash of lightning, she suddenly drew a dagger from her scarlet
      girdle, and held it out to them. Nerved as he was to meet danger, Pasquin
      Leroy recoiled slightly, while his two companions started as if to defend
      him. As she saw this, the woman raised her drooping eyelids, and a pair of
      wonderful eyes shone forth, dark blue as iris-flowers, while a faint
      scornful smile lifted the corners of her mouth. But she said nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is no cause to fear!" said Sergius Thord, glancing with a touch of
      derision in his looks from one to the other, "Lotys is the witness of all
      our vows! Swear now after me upon this drawn dagger which she holds,&mdash;lay
      your right hands here upon the blade!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus adjured, Pasquin Leroy approached, and placed his right hand upon the
      shining steel.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I swear in the name of God, and in the presence of Lotys, that I will
      faithfully work for the Cause of the Revolutionary Committee,&mdash;and
      that I will adhere to its rules and obey its commands, till all shall be
      done that is destined to be done! And may the death I deserve come
      suddenly upon me if ever I break my vow!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Slowly and emphatically Pasquin Leroy repeated this formula after Sergius
      Thord, and his two companions did the same, though perhaps less audibly.
      This ceremony performed, the woman called Lotys looked at them
      steadfastly, and the smile that played on her lips changed from scorn to
      sweetness. The dark blue iris-coloured eyes deepened in lustre, and
      flashed brilliantly from under their drowsy lids,&mdash;a rosy flush
      tinted the clear paleness of her skin, and like a statue warming to life
      she became suddenly beautiful.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have sworn bravely!" she said, in a low thrilling voice. "Now sign
      and seal!"
    </p>
    <p>
      As she spoke she lifted her bare left arm, and pricked it with the point
      of the dagger. A round, full drop of blood like a great ruby welled up on
      the white skin. All the men had risen from their places, and were gathered
      about her;&mdash;this 'taking of the oath' was evidently the dramatic
      event of their existence as a community.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The pen, Sergius!" she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thord approached with a white unused quill, and a vellum scroll on which
      the names of all the members of the Society were written in ominous red.
      He handed these writing implements to Leroy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dip your pen here," said Lotys, pointing to the crimson drop on her arm,
      and eyeing him still with the same half-sweet, half-doubting smile&mdash;"But
      when the quill is full, beware that you write no treachery!"
    </p>
    <p>
      For one second Leroy appeared to hesitate. He was singularly unnerved by
      the glances of those dark blue eyes, which like searchlights seemed to
      penetrate into every nook and cranny of his soul. But his recklessness and
      love of adventure having led him so far, it was now too late to retract or
      to reconsider the risks he might possibly be running. He therefore took
      the quill and dipped it into the crimson drop that welled from that soft
      white flesh.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This is the strangest ink I have ever used!" he said lightly,&mdash;"but&mdash;at
      your command, Madame&mdash;&mdash;!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "At my command," rejoined Lotys, "your use of it shall make your oath
      indelible!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He smiled, and wrote his name boldly 'Pasquin Leroy' and held out the pen
      for his companions to follow his example.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ach Gott!" exclaimed Max Graub, as he dipped the pen anew into the vital
      fluid from a woman's veins&mdash;"I write my name, Madame, in words of
      life, thanks to your condescension!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "True!" she answered,&mdash;"And only by your own falsehood can you change
      them into words of death!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Signing his name 'Max Graub,' he looked up and met her searching gaze.
      Something there was in the magnetic depth of her eyes that strangely
      embarrassed him, for he stepped back hastily as though intimidated. Axel
      Regor took the pen from his hand, and wrote his name, or rather scrawled
      it carelessly, almost impatiently,&mdash;showing neither hesitation nor
      repugnance to this unusual method of subscribing a document.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are acting on compulsion!" said Lotys, addressing him in a low tone;
      "Your compliance is in obedience to some other command than ours! And&mdash;you
      will do well to remain obedient!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Axel Regor gave her an amazed glance,&mdash;but she paid no heed to it,
      and binding her arm with her kerchief, let her long white sleeve fall over
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So, you are enrolled among the sons of my blood!" she said, "So are you
      bound to me and mine!" She moved to the further end of the table and stood
      there looking round upon them all. Again the slow, sweet, half-disdainful
      smile irradiated her features. "Well, children!&mdash;what else remains to
      do? What next? What next can there be but drink&mdash;smoke&mdash;talk!
      Man's three most cherished amusements!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She sat down, throwing back her heavy cloak on either side of her. Her
      hair had come partly unbound, and noticing a tress of it falling on her
      shoulder, she drew out the comb and let it fall altogether in a mass of
      gold-brown, like the tint of a dull autumn leaf, flecked here and there
      with amber. Catching it dexterously in one hand, she twisted it up again
      in a loose knot, thrusting the comb carelessly through.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Drink&mdash;smoke&mdash;talk, Sergius!" she repeated, still smiling;
      "Shall I ring?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Sergius Thord stood looking at her irresolutely, with the half-angry,
      half-pleading expression of a chidden child.
    </p>
    <p>
      "As you please, Lotys!" he answered. Whereupon she pressed an invisible
      spring under the table, which set a bell ringing in some lower quarter of
      the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pasquin Leroy, Axel Regor, Max Graub!" she said&mdash;"Take your places
      for to-night beside me&mdash;newcomers are always thus distinguished! And
      all of you sit down! You are grouped at present like hungry wolves waiting
      to spring. But you are not really hungry, except for something which is
      not food! And you are not waiting for anything except for permission to
      talk! I give it to you&mdash;talk, children! Talk yourselves hoarse! It
      will do you good! And I will personate supreme wisdom by listening to you
      in silence!"
    </p>
    <p>
      A kind of shamed laugh went round the company,&mdash;then followed the
      scuffling of feet, and grating of chairs against the floor, and presently
      the table was completely surrounded, the men sitting close up together,
      and Sergius Thord occupying his place at their head.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they were all seated, they formed a striking assembly of distinctly
      marked personalities. There were very few mean types among them, and the
      stupid, half-vague and languid expression of the modern loafer or 'do
      nothing' creature, who just for lack of useful work plots mischief, was
      not to be seen on any of their countenances. A certain moroseness and
      melancholy seemed to brood like a delayed storm among them, and to cloud
      the very atmosphere they breathed, but apart from this, intellectuality
      was the dominant spirit suggested by their outward looks and bearing.
      Plebeian faces and vulgar manners are, unfortunately, not rare in
      representative gatherings of men whose opinions are allowed to sway the
      destinies of nations, and it was strange to see a group of individuals who
      were sworn to upset existing law and government so distinguished by
      refined and even noble appearance. Their clothes were shabby,&mdash;their
      aspect certainly betokened long suffering and contention with want and
      poverty, but they were, taken all together, a set of men who, if they had
      been members of a recognized parliament or senate, would have presented a
      fine collection of capable heads to an observant painter. As soon as they
      were gathered round the table under the presidency of Sergius Thord at one
      end, and the tranquil tolerance of the mysterious Lotys at the other, they
      broke through the silence and reserve which they had carefully maintained
      till their three new comrades had been irrecoverably enrolled among them,
      and conversation went on briskly. The topic of 'The King <i>versus</i> the
      Jesuits' was one of the first they touched upon, Sergius Thord relating
      for the benefit of all his associates, how he had found Pasquin Leroy
      reading by lamplight the newspaper which reported his Majesty's refusal to
      grant any portion of Crown lands to the priests, and which also spoke of
      'Thord's Rabble.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "Here is the paper!" said Leroy, as he heard the narration; "Whoever likes
      to keep it can do so, as a memento of my introduction to this Society!"
    </p>
    <p>
      And he tossed it lightly on the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good!" exclaimed Paul Zouche; "Give it to me, and I will cherish it as a
      kind of birthday card! What a rag it is! 'Thord's Rabble' eh! Sergius,
      what have you been doing that this little flea of an editor should jump
      out of his ink-pot and bite you? Does he hurt much?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hurt!" Thord laughed aloud. "If I had money enough to pay the man ten
      golden coins a week where his present employer gives him five, he would
      dance to any tune I whistled!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is that so?" asked Leroy, with interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you not know that it is so?" rejoined Thord. "You tell me you write
      Socialistic works&mdash;you should know something concerning the press."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah!" said Max Graub, nodding his head sagely, "He does know much, but not
      all! It would need more penetration than even <i>he</i> possesses, to know
      all! Alas!&mdash;my friend was never a popular writer!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Like myself!" exclaimed Zouche, "I am not popular, and I never shall be.
      But I know how to make myself reputed as a great genius, and all the very
      respectable literary men are beginning to recognize me as such. Do you
      know why?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because you drink more than is good for you, my poor Zouche!" said Lotys
      tranquilly; "That is one reason!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hear her!" cried Zouche,&mdash;"Does she not always, like the Sphinx,
      propound enigmas! Lotys,&mdash;little, domineering Lotys, why in the name
      of Heaven should I secure recognition as a poet, through drunkenness?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because your vice kills your genius," said Lotys; "Therefore you are
      quite safe! If you were less of a scamp you would be a great man,&mdash;perhaps
      the greatest in the country! That would never do! Your rivals would never
      forgive you! But you are a hopeless rascal, incapable of winning much
      honour; and so you are compassionately recognized as somebody who might do
      something if he only would&mdash;that is all, my Zouche! You are an
      excellent after-dinner topic with those who are more successful than
      yourself; and that is the only fame you will ever win, believe me!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now by all the gods and goddesses!" cried Paul&mdash;"I do protest&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "After supper, Zouche!" interrupted Lotys, as the door of the room opened,
      and a man entered, bearing a tray loaded with various eatables, jugs of
      beer, and bottles of spirituous liquors,&mdash;"Protest as much as you
      like then,&mdash;but not just now!"
    </p>
    <p>
      And with quick, deft hands she helped to set the board. None of the men
      offered to assist her, and Leroy watching her, felt a sudden sense of
      annoyance that this woman should seem, even for a moment, to be in the
      position of a servant to them all.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can I do nothing for you?" he said, in a low tone&mdash;"Why should you
      wait upon us?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why indeed!" she answered&mdash;"Except that you are all by nature
      awkward, and do not know how to wait properly upon yourselves!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes had a gleam of mischievous mockery in them; and Leroy was
      conscious of an irritation which he could scarcely explain to himself.
      Decidedly, he thought, this Lotys was an unpleasant woman. She was
      'extremely plain,' so he mentally declared, in a kind of inward huff,&mdash;though
      he was bound to concede that now and then she had a very beautiful, almost
      inspired expression. After all, why should she not set out jugs and
      bottles, and loaves of bread, and hunks of ham and cheese before these
      men? She was probably in their pay! Scarcely had this idea flashed across
      his mind than he was ashamed of it. This Lotys, whoever she might actually
      be, was no paid hireling; there was something in her every look and action
      that set her high above any suspicion that she would accept the part of a
      salaried <i>comédienne</i> in the Socialist farce. Annoyed with himself,
      though he knew not why, he turned his gaze from her to the man who had
      brought in the supper,&mdash;a hunchback, who, notwithstanding his
      deformity, was powerfully built, and of a countenance which, marked as it
      was with the drawn pathetic look of long-continued physical suffering, was
      undeniably handsome. His large brown eyes, like those of a faithful dog,
      followed every movement of Lotys with anxious and wistful affection, and
      Leroy, noticing this, began to wonder whether she was his wife or
      daughter? Or was she related in either of these ways to Sergius Thord? His
      reflections were interrupted by a slight touch from Max Graub who was
      seated next to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will you drink with these fellows?" said Graub, in a cautious whisper&mdash;"Expect
      to be ill, if you do!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You shall prescribe for me!" answered Leroy in the same low tone&mdash;"I
      faithfully promise to call in your assistance! But drink with them I must,
      and will!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Graub gave a short sigh and a shrug, and said no more. The hunchback was
      going the round of the table, filling tall glasses with light Bavarian
      beer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where is the little Pequita?" asked Zouche, addressing him&mdash;"Have
      you sent her to bed already, Sholto?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Sholto looked timorously round till he met the bright reassuring glance of
      Lotys, and then he replied hesitatingly&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes!&mdash;no&mdash;I have not sent the little one to bed;&mdash;she
      returned from her work at the theatre, tired out&mdash;quite tired out,
      poor child! She is asleep now."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ha ha! A few years more, and she will not sleep!" said Zouche&mdash;"Once
      in her teens&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Once in her teens, she leaves the theatre and comes to me," said Lotys,
      "And you will see very little of her, Zouche, and you will know less! That
      will do, Sholto! Good-night!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good-night!" returned the hunchback&mdash;"I thank you, Madame!&mdash;I
      thank you, gentlemen!"
    </p>
    <p>
      And with a slight salutation, not devoid of grace, he left the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Zouche was sulky, and pushing aside his glass of beer, poured out for
      himself some strong spirit from a bottle instead.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You do not favour me to-night, Lotys," he said irritably&mdash;"You
      interrupt and cross me in everything I say!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is it not a woman's business to interrupt and cross a man?" queried
      Lotys, with a laugh,&mdash;"As I have told you before, Zouche, I will not
      have Sholto worried!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who worries him?" grumbled Zouche&mdash;"Not I!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, you!&mdash;you worry him on his most sensitive point&mdash;his
      daughter," said Lotys;&mdash;"Why can you not leave the child alone?
      Sholto is an Englishman," she explained, turning to Pasquin Leroy and his
      companions&mdash;"His history is a strange one enough. He is the rightful
      heir to a large estate in England, but he was born deformed. His father
      hated him, and preferred the second son, who was straight and handsome. So
      Sholto disappeared."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Disappeared!" echoed Leroy&mdash;"You mean&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I mean that he left his father's house one morning, and never returned.
      The clothes he wore were found floating in the river near by, and it was
      concluded that he had been drowned while bathing. The second son,
      therefore, inherited the property; and poor Sholto was scarcely missed;
      certainly not mourned. Meanwhile he went away, and got on board a Spanish
      trading boat bound for Cadiz. At Cadiz he found work, and also something
      that sweetened work&mdash;love! He married a pretty Spanish girl who
      adored him, and&mdash;as often happens when lovers rejoice too much in
      their love&mdash;she died after a year's happiness. Sholto is all alone in
      the world with the little child his Spanish wife left him, Pequita. She is
      only eleven years old, but her gift of dancing is marvellous, and she gets
      employment at one of the cheap theatres here. If an influential manager
      could see her performance, she might coin money."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The influential manager would probably cheat her," said Zouche,&mdash;"Things
      are best left alone. Sholto is content!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you content?" asked Johan Zegota, helping himself from the bottle
      that stood near him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I? Why, no! I should not be here if I were!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Discontent, then, is your chief bond of union?" said Axel Regor,
      beginning to take part in the conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is the very knot that ties us all together!" said Zouche with
      enthusiasm.&mdash;"Discontent is the mother of progress! Adam was
      discontented with the garden of Eden,&mdash;and found a whole world
      outside its gates!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He took Eve with him to keep up the sickness of dissatisfaction," said
      Zegota; "There would certainly have been no progress without <i>her</i>!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pardon,&mdash;Cain was the true Progressivist and Reformer," put in
      Graub; "Some fine sentiment of the garden of Eden was in his blood, which
      impelled him to offer up a vegetable sacrifice to the Deity, whereas Abel
      had already committed murder by slaying lambs. According to the legend,
      God preferred the 'savour' of the lambs, so perhaps,&mdash;who knows!&mdash;the
      idea that the savour of Abel might be equally agreeable to Divine senses
      induced Cain to kill him as a special 'youngling.' This was a Progressive
      act,&mdash;a step beyond mere lambs!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Everyone laughed, except Sergius Thord. He had fallen into a heavy,
      brooding silence, his head sunk on his breast, his wild hair falling
      forward like a mane, and his right hand clenched and resting on the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sergius!" called Lotys.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He is in one of his far-away moods,"&mdash;said one of the men next to
      Axel Regor,&mdash;"It is best not to disturb him."
    </p>
    <p>
      Paul Zouche, however, had no such scruples. "Sergius!" he cried,&mdash;"Come
      out of your cloud of meditation! Drink to the health of our three new
      comrades!"
    </p>
    <p>
      All the members of the company filled their glasses, and Thord, hearing
      the noise and clatter, looked up with a wild stare.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What are you doing?" he asked slowly;&mdash;"I thought some one spoke of
      Cain killing Abel!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was I," said Graub&mdash;"I spoke of it&mdash;irreverently, I fear,&mdash;but
      the story itself is irreverent. The notion that 'God,' should like roast
      meat is the height of blasphemy!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Zouche burst into a violent fit of laughter. But Thord went on talking in
      a low tone, as though to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Cain killing Abel!" he repeated&mdash;"Always the same horrible story is
      repeated through history&mdash;brother against brother,&mdash;blood crying
      out for blood&mdash;life torn from the weak and helpless body&mdash;all
      for what? For a little gold,&mdash;a passing trifle of power! Cain killing
      Abel! My God, art Thou not yet weary of the old eternal crime!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He spoke in a semi-whisper which thrilled through the room. A momentary
      hush prevailed, and then Lotys called again, her voice softened to a
      caressing sweetness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sergius!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He started, and shook himself out of his reverie this time. Raising his
      hand, he passed it in a vague mechanical way across his brow as though
      suddenly wakened from a dream.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, yes! Let us drink to our three new comrades," he said, and rose to
      his feet. "To your health, friends! And may you all stand firm in the hour
      of trial!"
    </p>
    <p>
      All the company sprang up and drained their glasses, and when the toast
      was drunk and they were again seated, Pasquin Leroy asked if he might be
      allowed to return thanks.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do not know," he said with a courteous air, "whether it is permissible
      for a newly-enrolled associate of this Brotherhood to make a speech on the
      first night of his membership,&mdash;but after the cordial welcome I and
      my comrades, strangers as we are, have received at your hands, I should
      like to say a few words&mdash;if, without breaking any rules of the Order,
      I may do so."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hear, hear!" shouted Zouche, who had been steadily drinking for the last
      few moments,&mdash;"Speak on, man! Whoever heard of a dumb Socialist! Rant&mdash;rant!
      Rant and rave!&mdash;as I do, when the fit is on me! Do I not, Thord? Do I
      not move you even to tears?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And laughter!" put in Zegota. "Hold your tongue, Zouche! No other man can
      talk at all, if you once begin!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Zouche laughed, and drained his glass.
    </p>
    <p>
      "True!&mdash;my genius is of an absorbing quality! Silence, gentlemen!
      Silence for our new comrade! 'Pasquin' stands for the beginning of a jest&mdash;so
      we may hope he will be amusing,&mdash;'Leroy' stands for the king, and so
      we may expect him to be non-political!"

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VIII. &mdash; THE KING'S DOUBLE
    </h2>
    <p>
      As Leroy rose to speak, there was a little commotion. Max Graub upset his
      glass, and seemed to be having a struggle under the table with Axel Regor.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What ails you?" said Leroy, glancing at his friends with an amazed air&mdash;"Are
      you quarrelling?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quarrelling!" echoed Max Graub, "Why, no&mdash;but what man will have his
      beer upset without complaint? Tell me that!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You upset it!" said Regor angrily&mdash;"I did not."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You did!" retorted Graub, "and because I pushed you for it, you showed me
      a pistol in your pocket! I object to be shown a pistol. So I have taken it
      away. Here it is!" and he laid the weapon on the table in front of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      A look of anger darkened Leroy's brows.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was not aware you carried arms," he said coldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sergius Thord noticed his annoyance.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is nothing remarkable in that, my friend!" he interposed&mdash;"We
      all carry arms,&mdash;there is not one of us at this table who has not a
      loaded pistol,&mdash;even Lotys is no exception to this rule."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now by my word!" said Graub, "<i>I</i> have no loaded pistol,&mdash;and I
      will swear Leroy is equally unarmed!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Entirely so!" said Leroy quietly&mdash;"I never suspect any man of evil
      intentions towards me."
    </p>
    <p>
      As he said this, Lotys leaned forward impulsively and stretched out her
      hand,&mdash;a beautiful hand, well-shaped and white as a white rose petal.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I like you for that!"&mdash;she said&mdash;"It is the natural attitude of
      a brave man!"
    </p>
    <p>
      A slight colour warmed his bronzed skin as he took her hand, pressed it
      gently, and let it go again. Axel Regor looked up defiantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I <i>do</i> suspect every man of evil intentions!" he said, "So you
      may all just as well know the worst of me at once! My experience of life
      has perhaps been exceptionally unpleasant; but it has taught me that as a
      rule no man is your friend till you have made it worth his while!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "By favours bestowed, or favours to come?" queried Thord, smiling,&mdash;"However,
      without any argument, Axel Regor, I am inclined to think you are right!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then a weapon is permissible here?" asked Graub.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not only permissible, but necessary," replied Thord. "As members of this
      Brotherhood we live always prepared for some disaster,&mdash;always on our
      guard against treachery. Comrades!" and raising his voice he addressed the
      whole party. "Lay down your arms, all at once and together!"
    </p>
    <p>
      In one instant, as if in obedience to a military order, the table was
      lined on either side with pistols. Beside these weapons, there was a
      goodly number of daggers, chiefly of the small kind such as are used in
      Corsica, encased in leather sheaths. Pasquin Leroy smiled as he saw Lotys
      lay down one of those tiny but deadly weapons, together with a small
      silver-mounted pistol.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Forewarned is forearmed!" he said gaily;&mdash;"Madame, if I ever offend,
      I shall look to you for a happy dispatch! Gentlemen, I have still to make
      my speech, and if you permit it, I will speak now,&mdash;unarmed as I am,&mdash;with
      all these little metal mouths ready to deal death upon me if I happen to
      make any observation which may displease you!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "By Heaven! A brave man!" cried Zouche; "Thord, you have picked up a trump
      card! Speak, Pasquin Leroy! We will forgive you, even if you praise the
      King!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Leroy stood silent for a moment, as if thinking. His two companions looked
      up at him once or twice in unquestionable alarm and wonderment, but he did
      not appear to be conscious of their observation. On the contrary, some
      very deeply seated feeling seemed to be absorbing his soul,&mdash;and it
      was perhaps this suppressed emotion which gave such a rich vibrating force
      to his accents when he at last spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Friends and Brothers!" he said;&mdash;"It is difficult for one who has
      never experienced the three-fold sense of Liberty, Equality and Fraternity
      until to-night, to express in the right manner the sense of gratitude
      which I, a complete stranger to you, feel for the readiness and cordiality
      of the welcome you have extended to me and my companions, accepting us
      without hesitation, as members of your Committee, and as associates in the
      work of the Cause you have determined to maintain. It is an Ideal Cause,&mdash;I
      need not tell you that! To rescue and protect the poor from the tyranny of
      the rich and strong, was the mission of Christ when He visited this earth;
      and it would perhaps be unwise on my part, and discouraging to yourselves,
      to remind you that even He has failed! The strong, the selfish, and the
      cruel, still delight in oppressing their more helpless fellows, despite
      the theories of Christianity. And it is perfectly natural that it should
      be so, seeing that the Christian Church itself has become a mere system of
      money-making and self-advancement."
    </p>
    <p>
      A burst of applause interrupted him. Eyes lightened with eager enthusiasm,
      and every face was turned towards him. He went on:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "To think of the great Founder of a great Creed, and then to consider what
      his pretended followers have made of Him and His teaching, is sufficient
      to fill the soul with the sickness of despair and humiliation! To remember
      that Christ came to teach all men the Gospel of love,&mdash;and to find
      them after eighteen hundred years still preferring the Gospel of hate,&mdash;is
      enough to make one doubt the truth of religion altogether! The Divine
      Socialist preached a creed too good and pure for this world; and when we
      try to follow it, we are beaten back on all sides by the false
      conventionalities and customs of a sacerdotal system grown old in
      self-seeking, not in self-sacrifice. Were Christ to come again, the first
      thing He would probably do would be to destroy all the churches, saying:
      'I never knew you: depart from me ye that work iniquity!' But till He does
      come again, it rests with the thinkers of the time to protest against
      wrongs and abuses, even if they cannot destroy them,&mdash;to expose
      falsehood, even if they cannot utterly undo its vicious work. Seeing,
      however, that the greater majority of men are banded on the side of wealth
      and material self-interest, it is unfortunately only a few who remain to
      work for the cause of the poor, and for such equal rights of justice as
      you&mdash;as we&mdash;in our present Association claim to be most worthy
      of man's best efforts. It may be asked by those outside such a Fraternity
      as ours,&mdash;'What do they want? What would they have that they cannot
      obtain?' I would answer that we want to see the end of a political system
      full of bribery and corruption,&mdash;that we desire the disgrace and
      exposure of such men as those, who, under the pretence of serving the
      country, merely line their own coffers out of the taxes they inflict upon
      the people;&mdash;and that if we see a king inclined to favour the
      overbearing dominance of a political party governed by financial
      considerations alone,&mdash;a party which has no consideration for the
      wider needs of the whole nation, we from our very hearts and souls desire
      the downfall of that king!"
    </p>
    <p>
      A low, deep murmur responded to his words,&mdash;a sound like the snarl of
      wolves, deep, fierce, and passionate. A close observer might perhaps have
      detected a sudden pallor on Leroy's face as he heard this ominous growl,
      and an involuntary clenching of the hand on the part of Axel Regor. Max
      Graub looked up.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah so, my friends! You hate the King?"
    </p>
    <p>
      No answer was vouchsafed to this query. The interruption was evidently
      unwelcome, all eyes being still fixed on Leroy. He went on tranquilly:
    </p>
    <p>
      "I repeat&mdash;that wherever and whenever a king&mdash;any king&mdash;voluntarily
      and knowingly, supports iniquity and false dealing in his ministers, he
      lays himself open to suspicion, attack, and dethronement! I speak with
      particular feeling on this point, because, apart from whatever may be the
      thoughts and opinions of these who are assembled here to-night, I have a
      special reason of my own for hating the King! That reason is marked on my
      countenance! I bear an extraordinary resemblance to him,&mdash;so great
      indeed, that I might be taken for his twin brother if he had one! And I
      beg of you, my friends, to look at me long and well, that you make no
      error concerning me, for, being now your comrade, I do not wish to be
      mistaken for your enemy!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He drew himself up, lifting his head with an air of indomitable pride and
      grace which well became him. An exclamation of surprise broke from all
      present, and Sergius Thord bent forward to examine his features with close
      attention. Every man at the table did the same, but none regarded him more
      earnestly or more searchingly than Lotys. Her wonderful eyes seemed to
      glow and burn with strange interior fires, as she kept them steadily fixed
      upon his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes&mdash;you are strangely like the King!" she said&mdash;"That is,&mdash;so
      far as I am able to judge by his portraits and coins. I have never seen
      him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I <i>have</i> seen him,"&mdash;said Sergius Thord, "though only at a
      distance. And I wonder I did not notice the strange resemblance you bear
      to him before you called my attention to it. Are you in any way related to
      him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Related to him!" Leroy laughed aloud. "No! If the late King had any
      bastard sons, I am not one of them! But I pray you again all to carefully
      note this hateful resemblance,&mdash;a resemblance I would fain rid me of&mdash;for
      it makes me seem a living copy of the man I most despise!"
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a pause,&mdash;during which he stood quietly, submitting himself
      to the fire of a hundred wondering, questioning, and inquisitorial eyes
      without flinching.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are all satisfied?" he then asked; "You, Sergius Thord,&mdash;my
      chief and commander,&mdash;you, and all here present are satisfied?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Satisfied?&mdash;Yes!" replied Thord; "But sorry that your personality
      resembles that of a fool and a knave!"
    </p>
    <p>
      A strange grimace distorted the countenance of Max Graub, but he quickly
      buried his nose and his expression together in a foaming glass of beer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You cannot be so sorry for me as I am for myself!" said Leroy, "And now
      to finish the few words I have been trying to say. I thank you from my
      heart for your welcome, and for the trust you have reposed in me and my
      companions. I am proud to be one of you; and I promise that you shall all
      have reason to be glad that I am associated with your Cause! And to prove
      my good faith, I undertake to set about working for you without a day's
      delay; and towards this object, I give you my word that before our next
      meeting something shall be done to shake the political stronghold of Carl
      Pérousse!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Sergius Thord sprang up excitedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do that," he said, "and were you a thousand times more like the King than
      you are, you shall be the first to command our service and honour!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Loud acclamation followed his words, and all the men gathered close up
      about Leroy. He looked round upon them, half-smiling, half-serious.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But you must tell me what to do!" he said. "You must explain to me why
      you consider Pérousse a traitor, and how you think it best his treachery
      should be proved. For, remember, I am a stranger to this part of the
      country, and my accidental resemblance to the King does not make me his
      subject!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "True!" said Paul Zouche,&mdash;his eyes were feverishly bright and his
      cheeks flushed&mdash;"To be personally like a liar does not oblige one to
      tell lies! To call oneself a poet does not enable one to write poetry! And
      to build a cathedral does not make one a saint! To know all the highways
      and byways of the Pérousse policy, you must penetrate into the depths and
      gutter-slushes of the great newspaper which is subsidised by the party to
      that policy! And this is difficult&mdash;exceedingly difficult, let me
      assure you, my bold Pasquin! And if you can perform such a 'pasquinade' as
      shall take you into these Holy of Holy purlieus of mischief and
      money-making, you will deserve to be chief of the Committee, instead of
      Sergius! Sergius talks&mdash;he will talk your head off!&mdash;but he does
      nothing!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do what I can,"&mdash;said Thord, patiently. "It is true I have no
      access to the centres of diplomacy or journalism. But I hold the People in
      the hollow of my hand!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He spoke with deep and concentrated feeling, and the power of his soul
      looked out eloquently from the darkening flash of his eyes. Leroy studied
      his features with undisguised interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you thus hold the People," he said,&mdash;"Why not bid them rise
      against the evil and tyranny of which they have cause to complain?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Thord shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      "To rouse the People," he replied, "would be worse than to rouse a herd of
      starving lions from their forest dens, and give them freedom to slay and
      devour! Nay!&mdash;the time is not yet! All gentle means must be tried;
      and if these fail&mdash;why then&mdash;!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He broke off, but his clenched hand and expressive glance said the rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why do you not use the most powerful of all the weapons ever invented for
      the destruction of one's enemies&mdash;the Pen?" asked Max Graub. "Start a
      newspaper, for example, and gibbet your particular favourite Carl Pérousse
      therein!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bah! He would get up a libel case, and advertise himself a little more by
      that method!" said Zegota contemptuously; "And besides, a newspaper needs
      unlimited capital behind it. We have no rich friends."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Rich friends!" exclaimed Lotys suddenly; "Who speaks of them&mdash;who
      needs them? Rich friends expect you to toady to them; to lick the ground
      under their feet; to fawn and flatter and lie, and be anything but honest
      men! The rich are the vulgar of this world;&mdash;no one who has heart, or
      soul, or sense, would condescend to seek friendships among those whose
      only claim to precedence is the possession of a little more yellow metal
      than their neighbours."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nevertheless, they and their yellow metal are the raw material, which
      Genius may as well use to pave its way through life," said Zegota. "Lotys,
      you are too much of an idealist!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Idealist! And you call yourself a realist, poor child!" said Lotys with a
      laugh; "I tell you I would sooner starve than accept favour or assistance
      from the merely rich!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course you would!" said Zouche, "And is not that precisely the reason
      why you are set in dominion over us all? We men are not sure of ourselves&mdash;but&mdash;Heaven
      knows why!&mdash;we are sure of You! I suppose it is because you are sure
      of yourself! For example, we men are such wretched creatures that we
      cannot go long without our food,&mdash;but you, woman, can fast all day,
      and scorn the very idea of hunger. We men cannot bear much pain,&mdash;but
      you,&mdash;woman,&mdash;can endure suffering of your own without
      complaint, while attending to our various lesser hurts and scratches.
      Wherefore, just because we feel you are above us in this and many other
      things, we have set you amongst us as a warning Figurehead, which cries
      shame upon us if we falter, and reminds us that you, a woman, can do, and
      probably will do, what we men cannot. Imagine it! You would bear all
      things for love's sake!&mdash;and, frankly speaking, we would bear nothing
      at all, except for our own immediate and particular pleasure. For that, of
      course, we would endure everything till we got it, and then&mdash;pouf!&mdash;we
      would let it go again in sheer weariness and desire for something else! Is
      it not so, Sergius?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am glad you know yourself so well!" said Thord gloomily. "Personally, I
      am not prepared to accept your theory."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Men are children!" said Lotys, still smiling; "And should be treated as
      children always, by women! Come, little ones! To bed, all of you! It is
      growing late, and the rain has ceased."
    </p>
    <p>
      She went to the window, and unbarring the shutters, opened it. The streets
      were wet and glistening below, but the clouds had cleared, and a pale
      watery moon shone out fitfully from the misty sky.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Say good-night, and part;" she continued. "It is time! This day month we
      will meet here again,&mdash;and our new comrades will then report what
      progress they have made in the matter of Carl Pérousse."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tell me," said Leroy, approaching her, "What would you do, Madame, if you
      had determined, on proving the corruption and falsehood of this at present
      highly-honoured servant of the State?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I should gain access to his chief tool, David Jost, by means of the Prime
      Minister's signet," said Lotys,&mdash;"If I could get the signet!&mdash;which
      I cannot! Nor can you! But if I could, I should persuade Jost to talk
      freely, and so betray himself. He and Carl Pérousse move the Premier and
      the King whichever way they please."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is that so&mdash;?" began Leroy, when he was answered by a dozen voices
      at once:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "The King is a fool!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The King is a slave!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The King accepts everything that is set before him as being rightly and
      wisely ordained,&mdash;and never enquires into the justice of what is
      done!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The King assumes to be the friend of the People, but if you ask him to do
      anything for the People, you only get the secretary's usual answer&mdash;'His
      Majesty regrets that it is impossible to take any action in the matter'!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wait!&mdash;wait!&mdash;" said Leroy, with a gesture which called for a
      moment's silence; "The question is,&mdash;<i>Could</i> the King do
      anything if he would?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will answer that!" said Lotys, her eyes flashing, her bosom heaving,
      and her whole figure instinct with pride and passion; "The King could do
      everything! The King could be a man if he chose, instead of a dummy! The
      King could cease to waste his time on fools and light women!&mdash;and
      though he is, and must be a constitutional Monarch, he could so rule all
      social matters as to make them the better,&mdash;not the worse for his
      influence! There is nothing to prevent the King from doing his most kingly
      duty!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Leroy looked at her for a moment in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Madame, if the King heard your words he might perhaps regret his many
      follies!" he said courteously;&mdash;"But where Society is proved worse,
      instead of better for a king's influence, is it not somewhat too late to
      remedy the evil? What of the Queen?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Queen is queen from necessity, not from choice!" said Lotys;&mdash;"She
      has never loved her husband. If she had loved him, perhaps he might,&mdash;through
      her,&mdash;have loved his people more!"
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a note of pathos in her voice that was singularly tender and
      touching. Anon, as if impatient with herself, she turned to Sergius Thord.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We must disperse!" she said abruptly; "Daybreak will be upon us before we
      know it, and we have done no business at all this evening. To enrol three
      new associates is a matter of fifteen minutes; the rest of our time has
      been wasted!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do not say so, Madame!" interposed Max Graub, "You have three new friends&mdash;three
      new 'sons of your blood,' as you so poetically call them,&mdash;though,
      truly, I for one am more fit to be your grandfather! And do you consider
      the time wasted that has been spent in improving and instructing your
      newly-born children?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Lotys turned upon him with a look of disdain.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are a would-be jester;" she said coldly; "Old men love a jest, I
      know, but they should take care to make it at the right time, and in the
      right place. They should not play with edge-tools such as I am, though I
      suppose, being a German, you think little or nothing of women?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Madame!" protested Graub, "I think so much of women that I have never
      married! Behold me, an unhappy bachelor! I have spared any one of your
      beautiful sex from the cruel martyrdom of having to endure my life-long
      company!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She laughed&mdash;a pretty low laugh, and extended her hand with an air of
      queenly condescension.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are amusing!" she said,&mdash;"And so I will not quarrel with you!
      Good-night!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Auf wiedersehn!" and Graub kissed the white hand he held. "I shall hope
      you will command me to be of service to you and yours, ere long!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "In what way, I wonder," she asked dubiously; "What can you do best?
      Write? Speak? Or organize meetings?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think," said Graub, speaking very deliberately, "that of all my various
      accomplishments, which are many&mdash;as I shall one day prove to you&mdash;I
      can poison best!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Poison!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The exclamation broke simultaneously from all the company. Graub looked
      about him with a triumphant air.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah so,&mdash;I know I shall be useful," he said; "I can poison so very
      beautifully and well! One little drop&mdash;one, little microbe of
      mischief&mdash;and I can make all your enemies die of cholera, typhoid,
      bubonic plague, or what you please! I am what is called a Christian
      scientific poisoner&mdash;that is a doctor! You will find me a most
      invaluable member of this Brotherhood!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He nodded his head wisely, and smiled. Sergius Thord laid one hand heavily
      on his shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We shall find you useful, no doubt!" he said, "But mark me well, friend!
      Our mission is not to kill, but to save!&mdash;not to poison, but to heal!
      If we find that by the death of one traitor we can save the lives of
      thousands, why then that traitor must die. If we know that by killing a
      king we destroy a country's abuses, that king is sent to his account. But
      never without warning!&mdash;never without earnest pleading that he whom
      the laws of Truth condemn, may turn from the error of his ways and repent
      before it is too late. We are not murderers;&mdash;we are merely the
      servants of justice."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Exactly!" put in Paul Zouche; "You understand? We try to be what God is
      not,&mdash;just!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Blaspheme not, Zouche!" said Thord; "Justice is the very eye of God!&mdash;the
      very centre and foundation of the universe."
    </p>
    <p>
      Zouche laughed discordantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Excellent Sergius! Impulsive Sergius!&mdash;with big heart, big head and
      no logic! Prove to me this eternal justice! Where does it begin? In the
      creation of worlds without end, all doomed to destruction, and therefore
      perfectly futile in their existence? In the making of man, who lives his
      little day with the utmost difficulty, pain and struggle, and is then
      extinguished, to be heard of no more? The use of it, my Sergius!&mdash;point
      out the use of it! No,&mdash;there is no man can answer me that! If I
      could see the Creator, I would ask Him the question personally&mdash;but
      He hides Himself behind the great big pendulum He has set swinging&mdash;tick&mdash;tock!&mdash;tick&mdash;tock!
      Life&mdash;Death!&mdash;Life&mdash;Death!&mdash;and never a reason why the
      clock is set going! And so we shall never have justice,&mdash;simply
      because there is none! It is not just or reasonable to propound a question
      to which there is no answer; it is not just or reasonable to endow man
      with all the thinking powers of brain, and all the imaginative movements
      of mind, merely to turn him into a pinch of dust afterwards. Every
      generation, every country strives to get justice done, but cannot,&mdash;merely
      for the fact that God Himself has no idea of it, and therefore it is
      naturally lacking in His creature, man. Our governing-forces are plainly
      the elements. No Divine finger stops the earthquake from engulfing a
      village full of harmless inhabitants, simply because of the injustice of
      such utter destruction! See now!&mdash;look at the eyes of Lotys
      reproaching me! You would think they were the eyes of an angel, gazing at
      a devil in the sweet hope of plucking him out of hell!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Such a hope would be vain in your case, Zouche," said Lotys tranquilly;
      "You make your own hell, and you must live in it! Nevertheless, in some of
      the wild things you say, there is a grain of truth. If I were God, I
      should be the most miserable of all beings, to look upon all the misery I
      had myself created! I should be so sorry for the world, that I should put
      an end to all hope of immortality by my own death."
    </p>
    <p>
      She made this strange remark with a simplicity and wistfulness which were
      in striking contrast to the awful profundity of the suggestion, and all
      her auditors, including the half-tipsy Zouche, were silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I should be so sorry!" she repeated; "For even as a mortal woman my pity
      for the suffering world almost breaks my heart;&mdash;but if I were God, I
      should have all the griefs of all the worlds I had made to answer for,&mdash;and
      such an agony would surely kill me. Oh,&mdash;the pain, the tears, the
      mistakes, the sins, the anguish of humanity! All these are frightful to
      me! I do not understand why such misery should exist! I think it must be
      that we have not enough love in the world; if we only loved each other
      faithfully, God might love us more!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes were wet; she caught her breath hard, and smiled a little
      difficult smile. Something in her soul transfigured her face, and made it
      for the moment exquisitely lovely, and the men around her gazed at her in
      evidently reverential silence. Suddenly she stretched out both her hands:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good-night, children!"
    </p>
    <p>
      One by one the would-be-fierce associates of the Revolutionary Committee
      bent low over those fair hands; and then quietly saluting Sergius Thord,
      as quietly left the room, like schoolboys retiring from a class where the
      lessons had been more or less badly done. Paul Zouche was not very steady
      on his feet, and two of his comrades assisted him to walk as he stumbled
      off, singing somewhat of a ribald rhyme in <i>mezza-voce</i>. Pasquin
      Leroy and his two friends were the last to go. Lotys looked at them all
      three meditatively.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will be faithful?" she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Unto death!" answered Leroy.
    </p>
    <p>
      She came close up to him, placing one hand on his arm, and glanced
      meaningly towards Sergius Thord, who was standing at the threshold
      watching Zouche stumbling down the dark stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sergius is a good man!" she said; "One of the mistaken geniuses of this
      world,&mdash;savage as a lion, yet simple as a child! Whoever, and
      whatever you are, be true to him!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He is dear to you?" said Leroy on a sudden impulse, catching her hand;
      "He is more to you than most men?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She snatched away her hand, and her eyes lightened first with wrath, then
      with laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dear to me!" she echoed,&mdash;"to Me? No one man on earth is dearer to
      me than another! All are alike in my estimation,&mdash;all the same
      barbaric, foolish babes and children&mdash;all to be loved and pitied
      alike! But Sergius Thord picked me out of the streets when I was no better
      than a stray and starving dog,&mdash;and like a dog I serve him&mdash;faithfully!
      Now go!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She stretched out her hand in an attitude of command, and there was
      nothing for it but to obey. They therefore repeated their farewells, and
      in their turn, went out, one by one, down the tortuous staircase. Sholto,
      the hunchback, was below, and he let them out without a word, closing and
      barring the door carefully behind them. Once in the street and under the
      misty moonlight, Pasquin Leroy nodded a careless dismissal to his
      companions.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will return alone?" enquired Max Graub.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quite alone!" was the reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      "May I not follow you at a distance?" asked Axel Regor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leroy smiled. "You forget! One of the rules we have just sworn to conform
      to, is&mdash;'No member shall track, follow or enquire into the movements
      of any other member.' Go your ways! I will thank you both for your
      services to-morrow."
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned away rapidly and disappeared. His two friends remained gazing
      somewhat disconsolately after him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Shall we go?" at last said Max Graub.
    </p>
    <p>
      "When you please," replied Axel Regor irritably,&mdash;"The sooner the
      better for me! Here we are probably watched,&mdash;we had best go down to
      the quay, and from thence&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not finish his sentence, but Graub evidently understood its
      conclusion&mdash;and they walked quickly away together in quite an
      opposite direction to that in which Leroy had gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, up in the now closed and darkened house they had left behind
      them, Lotys stood looking at Sergius Thord, who had thrown himself into a
      chair and sat with his elbows resting on the table, and his head buried in
      his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You make no way, poor Sergius!" she said gently. "You work, you write,
      you speak to the people, but you make no way!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked up fiercely.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do make way!" he said; "How can you doubt it? A word from me, and the
      massed millions would rise as one man!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And of what use would that be?" enquired Lotys. "The soldiers would fire
      on the people, and there would be riot and bloodshed, but no actual
      redress for wrong. You work vainly, Sergius!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "If I could but kill the King!" he muttered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Another king would succeed him," she said. "And after all, if you only
      knew it, the King may be a miserable man enough&mdash;far more miserable,
      perhaps, than any of us imagine ourselves to be. No, Sergius!&mdash;I
      repeat it, you work vainly! You have made me the soul of an Ideal which
      you will never realise? Tell me, what is it you yourself would have, out
      of all your work and striving?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at her with great, earnest, burning eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Power!" he said. "Power to change the mode of government; power to put
      down the tyranny of priestcraft&mdash;power to relieve the oppressed, and
      reward the deserving&mdash;power to make of you, Lotys, a queen among
      women!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am a queen among men, Sergius, and that suffices me! How often must I
      tell you to do nothing for my sake, if it is for my sake only? I am a very
      simple, plain woman, past my youth, and without beauty&mdash;I deserve and
      demand nothing!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He raised himself, and stretched out his arms towards her with a gesture
      of entreaty.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You deserve all that a man can give you!" he said passionately. "I love
      you, Lotys! I have always loved you ever since I found you a little
      forsaken child, shivering and weeping on the cold marble steps of the
      Temesvar place in Buda. I love you!&mdash;you know I have always loved
      you!&mdash;I have told you so a hundred times,&mdash;I love you as few men
      love women!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She regarded him compassionately, and with a touch of wistful sorrow in
      her eyes. Her black cloak fell away on either side of her in two shadowy
      folds, disclosing her white-robed form and full bosom, like a pearl in a
      dark shell.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good-night, Sergius!" she said simply, and turned to go.
    </p>
    <p>
      He gave an exclamation of anger and pain.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is all you say&mdash;'Good-night'!" he muttered. "A man gives you
      his heart, and you set it aside with a cold word of farewell! And yet&mdash;and
      yet&mdash;you hold all my life!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am sorry, Sergius," she said, in a gentle voice; "very sorry that it is
      so. You have told me all this before; and I have answered you often, and
      always in the same way. I have no love to give you, save that which is the
      result of duty and gratitude. I do not forget!&mdash;I know that you
      rescued me from starvation and death&mdash;though sometimes I question
      whether it would not have been better to have let me die. Life is worth
      very little at its utmost best; nevertheless, I admit I have had a certain
      natural joy in living, and for that I have to thank you. I have tried to
      repay you by my service&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do not speak of that," he said hurriedly; "I have done nothing! You are a
      genius in yourself, and would have made your way anywhere,&mdash;perhaps
      better without me."
    </p>
    <p>
      She smiled doubtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am not sure! The trick of oratory does not carry one very far,&mdash;not
      when one is a woman! Good-night again, Sergius! Try to rest,&mdash;you
      look worn out. And do not think of winning power for my sake; what power I
      need I will win for myself!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He made no answer, but watched her with jealous eyes, as she moved towards
      the door. On the threshold she turned.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Those three new associates of yours&mdash;are they trustworthy, think
      you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He gave a gesture of indifference.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do not know! Who is there we can absolutely trust save ourselves? That
      man, Leroy, is honest,&mdash;of that I am confident,&mdash;and he has
      promised to be responsible for his friends."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah!" She paused a moment, then with another low breathed 'good-night' she
      left the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at the door as it closed behind her&mdash;at the chair she had
      left vacant.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lotys!" he whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      His whisper came hissing softly back to him in a fine echo on the empty
      space, and with a great sigh he rose, and began to turn out the flaring
      lamps above his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Power!&mdash;Power!" he muttered&mdash;"She could not resist it! She
      would never be swayed by gold,&mdash;but power! Her genius would rise to
      it&mdash;her beauty would grow to it like a rose unfolding in the sun!
      'Past youth, and without beauty' as she says of herself! My God! Compare
      the tame pink-and-white prettiness of youth with the face of Lotys,&mdash;and
      that prettiness becomes like a cheap advertisement on a hoarding or a
      match-box! Contrast the perfect features, eyes and hair of the newest
      social 'beauty,'&mdash;with the magical expression, the glamour in the
      eyes of Lotys,&mdash;and perfection of feature becomes the rankest
      ugliness! Once in a hundred centuries a woman is born like Lotys, to drive
      men mad with desire for the unattainable&mdash;to fire them with such
      ambition as should make them emperors of the world, if they had but
      sufficient courage to snatch their thrones&mdash;and yet,&mdash;to fill
      them with such sick despair at their own incompetency and failure, as to
      turn them into mere children crying for love&mdash;for love!&mdash;only
      love! No matter whether worlds are lost, kings killed, and dynasties
      concluded, love!&mdash;only love!&mdash;and then death!&mdash;as all
      sufficient for the life of a man! And only just so long as love is denied&mdash;just
      so long we can go on climbing towards the unreachable height of greatness,&mdash;then&mdash;once
      we touch love, down we fall, broken-hearted; but&mdash;we have had our
      day!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The room was now in darkness, save for the glimmer of the pale moon
      through the window panes, and he opened the casement and looked out. There
      was a faint scent of the sea on the air, and he inhaled its salty odour
      with a sense of refreshment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "All for Lotys!" he murmured. "Working for Lotys, plotting, planning,
      scheming for Lotys! The government intimidated,&mdash;the ministry cast
      out,&mdash;the throne in peril,&mdash;the people in arms,&mdash;the city
      in a blaze,&mdash;Revolution and Anarchy doing their wild work broad-cast
      together,&mdash;all for Lotys! Always a woman in it! Search to the very
      depth of every political imbroglio,&mdash;dig out the secret reason of
      every war that ever was begun or ended in the world,&mdash;and there we
      shall find the love or the hate of a woman at the very core of the
      business! Some such secrets history knows, and has chronicled,&mdash;and
      some will never be known,&mdash;but up to the present there is not even a
      religion in the world where a Woman is not made the beginning of a God!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He smiled somewhat grimly at his own fanciful musings, and then, shutting
      the window, retired. The house was soon buried in profound silence and
      darkness, and over the city tuneful bells rang the half-hour after
      midnight. Four miles distant from the 'quarter of the poor,' and high
      above the clustering houses of the whole magnificent metropolis, the Royal
      palace towered whitely on its proud eminence in the glimmer of the moon, a
      stately pile of turrets and pinnacles; and on the battlements the sentries
      walked, pacing to and fro in regular march, with regular changes, all
      through the night hours. Half after midnight! 'All's well!'
      Three-quarters, and still 'All's well' sounded with the clash of steel and
      a tinkle of silvery chimes. One o'clock struck,&mdash;and the drifting
      clouds in heaven cleared fully, showing many brilliant stars in the
      western horizon,&mdash;and a sentry passing, as noiselessly as his armour
      and accoutrements would permit, along the walled battlement which
      protected and overshadowed the windows of the Queen's apartments, paused
      in his walk to look with an approving eye at the clearing promise of the
      weather. As he did so, a tall figure, wrapped in a thick rain-cloak,
      suddenly made its unexpected appearance through a side door in the wall,
      and moved rapidly towards a turret which contained a secret passage
      leading to the Queen's boudoir,&mdash;a private stairway which was never
      used save by the Royal family. The sentry gave a sharp warning cry.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Halt! Who goes there?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The figure paused and turned, dropping its cloak. The pale moonlight fell
      slantwise on the features, disclosing them fully.
    </p>
    <p>
      "T is I! The King!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The soldier recoiled amazed,&mdash;and quickly saluted. Before he could
      recover from his astonishment he was alone again. The battlement was
      empty, and the door to the turret-stairs,&mdash;of which only the King
      possessed the key,&mdash;was fast locked; and for the next hour or more
      the startled sentry remained staring at the skies in a sort of meditative
      stupefaction, with the words still ringing like the shock of an alarm-bell
      in his ears:
    </p>
    <p>
      "'T is I! The King!"
    </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IX. &mdash; THE PREMIER'S SIGNET
    </h2>
    <p>
      The next day the sun rose with joyous brightness in a sky clear as
      crystal. Storm, wind, and rain had vanished like the flying phantoms of an
      evil dream, and all the beautiful land sparkled with light and life in its
      enlacing girdle of turquoise blue sea. The gardens of the Royal palace,
      freshened by the downpour of the past night, wore their most enchanting
      aspect,&mdash;roses, with leaves still wet, dropped their scented petals
      on the grass,&mdash;great lilies, with their snowy cups brimming with
      rain, hung heavily on their slim green stalks, and the air was full of the
      deliciously penetrating odour of the mimosa and sweetbriar. Down one
      special alley, where the white philadelphus, or 'mock orange' grew in
      thick bushes on either side, intermingled with ferns and spruce firs,
      whose young green tips exhaled a pungent, healthy scent that entered into
      the blood like wine and invigorated it, Sir Roger de Launay was pacing to
      and fro with a swinging step which, notwithstanding its ease and soldierly
      regularity, suggested something of impatience, and on a rustic seat, above
      which great clusters of the philadelphus-flowers hung like a canopy, sat
      Professor von Glauben, spectacles on nose, sorting a few letters which he
      had just taken from his pocket for the purpose of reading them over again
      carefully one by one. He was a very particular man as regarded his
      correspondence. All letters that required answering he answered at once,&mdash;the
      others, as he himself declared, 'answered themselves' in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is no end to the crop of fools in this world," he was fond of
      saying;&mdash;"Glorious, precious fools! I love them all! They make life
      worth living&mdash;but sometimes I am disposed to draw the line at
      letter-writing fools. These persons chance to read a book&mdash;my book
      for example,&mdash;that particularly clever one I wrote on the
      possibilities of eternal life in this world. They at once snatch their
      pens and write to say that they are specially deserving of this boon, and
      wish to live for ever&mdash;will I tell them how? And these are the very
      creatures I will not tell how&mdash;because their perpetual existence
      would be a mistake and a nuisance! The individuals whose lives are really
      valuable never ask anyone how to make them so."
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked over his letters now with a leisurely indifference. The
      morning's post had brought him nothing of special importance. He glanced
      from his reading now and again at De Launay marching up and down, but said
      nothing till he had quite finished with his own immediate concerns. Then
      he removed his spectacles from his nose and put them by.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Left&mdash;Right&mdash;Left&mdash;Right&mdash;Left&mdash;Right! Roger,
      you remind me of my drilling days on a certain flat and dusty ground at
      Coblentz! The Rhine!&mdash;the Rhine! Ah, the beautiful Rhine! So dirty&mdash;so
      dull&mdash;with its toy castles, and its big, ugly factory chimneys, and
      its atrociously bad wine! Roger, I beseech you to have mercy upon me, and
      leave off that marching up and down,&mdash;it gets on my nerves!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thought nothing ever got on your nerves," answered Sir Roger, stopping
      abruptly&mdash;"You seem to take serious matters coolly enough!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Serious matters demand coolness," replied Von Glauben. "We should only
      let steam out over trifles. Have you seen his Majesty this morning?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. I am to see him again at noon."
    </p>
    <p>
      "When do you go off duty?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not for a month, at least."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Much may happen in that month," said the Professor sententiously; "<i>Your</i>
      hair may grow white with the strangeness of your experiences!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Roger met his eyes, and they both laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Though it is no laughing matter," resumed Von Glauben. "Upon my soul as a
      German,&mdash;if I have any soul of that nationality,&mdash;I think it may
      be a serious business!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have come round to my opinion then," said De Launay. "I told you from
      the first that it was serious!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The King does not think it so," rejoined Von Glauben. "I was summoned to
      his presence early this morning, and found him in the fullest health and
      highest spirits."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why did he send for you then?" enquired De Launay.
    </p>
    <p>
      "To feel his pulse and look at his tongue! To make a little game of me
      before he stepped out of his dressing-gown! And I enjoyed it, of course,&mdash;one
      must always enjoy Royal pleasantries! I think, Roger, his Majesty wishes
      this entire affair treated as a pleasantry,&mdash;by us at any rate,
      however seriously he may regard it himself."
    </p>
    <p>
      De Launay was silent for a minute or two, then he said abruptly:
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Premier is summoned to a private audience of the King at noon."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah!" And Von Glauben drew a cluster of the overhanging philadelphus
      flowers down to his nose and smelt them approvingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And"&mdash;went on De Launay, speaking more deliberately, "this afternoon
      their Majesties sail to The Islands&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      Von Glauben jumped excitedly to his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not possible!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Roger looked at him with a dawning amusement beginning to twinkle in
      his clear blue eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quite possible! So possible, that the Royal yacht is ordered to be in
      readiness at three o'clock. Their Majesties and suite will dine on board,
      in order to enjoy the return sail by moonlight."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Professor's countenance was a study. Anxiety and vexation struggled
      with the shrewd kindness and humour of his natural expression, and his
      suppressed feelings found vent in a smothered exclamation, which sounded
      very much like the worst of blasphemous oaths used in dire extremity by
      the soldiers of the Fatherland.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What ails you?" demanded De Launay; "You seem strangely upset for a man
      of cool nerve!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Upset? Who&mdash;what can upset me? Nothing! Roger, if I did not respect
      you so much, I should call you an ass!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Roger laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Call me an ass, by all means," he said, "if it will relieve your
      feelings;&mdash;but in justice to me, let me know why you do so! What is
      my offence? I give you a piece of commonplace information concerning the
      movements of the Court this afternoon, and you jump off your seat as if an
      adder had bitten you. Why?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have the gout," said Von Glauben curtly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh!" And again Sir Roger laughed. "That last must have been a sharp
      twinge!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was&mdash;it was! Believe me, my excellent Roger, it was exceedingly
      severe!" His brow smoothed, and he smiled. "See here, my dear friend!&mdash;you
      know, do you not, that boys will be boys, and men will be men?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Both are recognised platitudes," replied Sir Roger, his eyes still
      twinkling merrily; "And both are frequently quoted to cover our various
      follies!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "True, true! But I wish to weigh more particularly on the fact that men
      will be men! I am a man, Roger,&mdash;not a boy!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Really! Well, upon my word, I should at this moment take you for a raw
      lad of about eighteen,&mdash;for you are blushing, Von Glauben!&mdash;actually
      blushing!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The Professor drew out a handkerchief, and wiped his brow.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is a warm morning, Roger," he said, with a mildly reproachful air; "I
      suppose I am permitted to feel the heat?" He paused&mdash;then with a
      sudden burst of impatience he exclaimed: "By the Emperor's head! It is of
      no use denying it&mdash;I am very much put out, Roger! I must get a boat,
      and slip off to The Islands at once!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Roger stared at him in complete amazement.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You? You want to slip off to The Islands? Why, Von Glauben&mdash;&mdash;!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes&mdash;yes,&mdash;I know! You cannot possibly imagine what I want to
      go there for! You wouldn't suppose, would you, that I had any special
      secrets&mdash;an old man like me;&mdash;for instance, you would not
      suspect me of any love secrets, eh?" And he made a ludicrous attempt to
      appear sentimental. "The fact is, Roger,&mdash;I have got into a little
      scrape over at The Islands&mdash;" here he looked warmer and redder than
      ever;&mdash;"and I want to take precautions! You understand&mdash;I want
      to take care that the King does not hear of it&mdash;Gott in Himmel! What
      a block of a man you are to stand there staring open-mouthed at me! Were
      you never in love yourself?
    </p>
    <p>
      "In love? In love!&mdash;you,&mdash;Professor? Pray pardon me&mdash;but&mdash;in
      love? Am I to understand that there is a lady in your case?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes!&mdash;that is it," said Von Glauben, with an air of profound relief;
      "There is a lady in my case;&mdash;or my case, speaking professionally, is
      that of a lady. And I shall get any sort of a sea-tub that is available,
      and go over to those accursed Islands without any delay!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "If the King should send for you while you are absent&mdash;" began De
      Launay doubtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He will not send. But if he should, what of it? I am known to be somewhat
      eccentric&mdash;particularly so in my love of hard work, fresh air and
      exercise&mdash;besides, he has not commanded my attendance. He will not,
      therefore, be surprised at my absence. I tell you, Roger,&mdash;I <i>must</i>
      go! Who would have expected the King to take it into his head to visit The
      Islands without a moment's warning! What a freak!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And here comes the reason of the freak, if I am not very much mistaken,"
      said De Launay, lowering his voice as an approaching figure flung its
      lengthy shadow on the path,&mdash;"Prince Humphry!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Von Glauben hastily drew back, De Launay also, to allow the Prince to
      pass. He was walking slowly, and reading as he came. Looking up from his
      book he saw, them, and as they saluted him profoundly, bade them good-day.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are up betimes, Professor," he said lightly; "I suppose your
      scientific wisdom teaches you the advantage of the morning air."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Truly, Sir, it is more healthful than that of the evening," answered Von
      Glauben in somewhat doleful accents.&mdash;"For example, a sail across the
      sea with the morning breeze, is better than the same sort of excursion in
      the glamour of the moon!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Prince Humphry looked steadfastly at him, and evidently read something of
      a warning, or a suggestion, in his face, for he coloured slightly and bit
      his lip.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you agree with that theory, Sir Roger," he said, turning to De Launay.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have not tested it, Sir," replied the equerry, "But I imagine that
      whatever Professor von Glauben asserts must be true!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man glanced quickly from one to the other, and then with a
      careless air turned over the pages of the book he held.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In the earlier ages of the world," he said,&mdash;"men and women, I
      think, must have been happier than they are now, if this book may be
      believed. I find here written down&mdash;What is it, Professor? You have
      something to say?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pardon me, Sir," said Von Glauben,&mdash;"But you said&mdash;'If this
      book may be believed.' I humbly venture to declare that no book may be
      believed!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not even your own, when it is written?" queried the Prince with a smile;
      "You would not like the world to say so! Nay, but listen, Professor,&mdash;here
      is a thought very beautifully expressed&mdash;and it was written in an
      ancient language of the East, thousands of years before we, in our quarter
      of the world, ever dreamt of civilization.&mdash;'Of all the sentiments,
      passions or virtues which in their divers turns affect the life of a man,
      the influence and emotion of Love is surely the greatest and highest. We
      do not here speak of the base and villainous craving of bodily appetite;
      but of that pure desire of the unfettered soul which beholding perfection,
      straightway and naturally flies to the same. This love doth so elevate and
      instruct a man, that he seeketh nothing better than to be worthy of it, to
      attempt great deeds and valiantly perform them, to confront foul abuses,
      and most potently destroy them,&mdash;and to esteem the powers and riches
      of this world as dross, weighed against this rare and fiery talisman. For
      it is a jewel which doth light up the heart, and make it strong to support
      all sorrow and ill fortune with cheerfulness, knowing that it is in itself
      of so lasting a quality as to subjugate all things and events unto its
      compelling sway.' What think you of this? Sir Roger, there is a whole
      volume of comprehension in your face! Give some word of it utterance!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Roger looked up.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is nothing to say, Sir," he replied; "Your ancient writer merely
      expresses a truth we are all conscious of. All poets, worthy the name, and
      all authors, save and except the coldest logicians, deem the world well
      lost for love."
    </p>
    <p>
      "More fools they!" said Von Glauben gruffly; "Love is a mere illusion,
      which is generally destroyed by one simple ceremony&mdash;Marriage!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Prince Humphry smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have never tried the cure, Professor," he said, "But I daresay you
      have suffered from the disease! Will you walk with me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Von Glauben bowed a respectful assent; and the Prince, with a kindly nod
      of dismissal to De Launay, went on his way, the Professor by his side. Sir
      Roger watched them as they disappeared, and saw, that at the furthest end
      of the alley, when they were well out of ear-shot, they appeared to engage
      in very close and confidential conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wonder," he mused, "I wonder what it all means? Von Glauben is
      evidently mixed up in some affair that he wishes to keep secret from the
      King. Can it concern Prince Humphry? And The Islands! What can Von Glauben
      want over there?"
    </p>
    <p>
      His brief meditation was interrupted by a soft voice calling.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Roger!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He started, and at once advanced to meet the approaching intruder, his
      sister, Teresa de Launay, a pretty brunette, with dark sparkling eyes, one
      of the favourite ladies of honour in attendance on the Queen.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What were you dreaming about?" she asked, as he came near, "And what is
      the Prince doing with old Von Glauben?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Two questions at once, Teresa!" he said, stooping his tall head to kiss
      her; "I cannot possibly answer both in a breath! But answer me just one&mdash;What
      are you here for?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "To summon <i>you</i>!" she answered. "The Queen desires you to wait upon
      her immediately."
    </p>
    <p>
      She fixed her bright eyes upon him as she spoke, and an involuntary sigh
      escaped her, as she noted the touch of pallor that came on his face at her
      words.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where is her Majesty?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Here&mdash;close at hand&mdash;in the arbour. She spied you at a distance
      through the trees, and sent me to fetch you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You had best return to her at once, and say that I am coming."
    </p>
    <p>
      His sister looked at him again, and hesitated&mdash;he gave a slight,
      vexed gesture of impatience, whereupon she hurried away, with flying
      footsteps as light as those of a fabled sylph of the woodlands. He watched
      her go, and for a moment an expression came into his eyes of intense
      suffering&mdash;the look of a noble dog who is suddenly struck
      undeservedly by an unkind master.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She sends for me!" he muttered; "What for? To amuse herself by reading
      every thought of my life with her cold eyes? Why can she not leave me
      alone?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He walked on then, with a quiet, even pace, and presently reaching the end
      of the alley, came out on a soft stretch of greensward facing a small
      ornamental lake and fountain. Here grew tall rushes, bamboos and
      flag-flowers&mdash;here, too, on the quiet lake floated water-lilies,
      white and pink, opening their starry hearts to the glory of the morning
      sun. A quaintly shaped, rustic arbour covered with jasmine, faced the
      pool, and here sat the Queen alone and unattended, save by Teresa de
      Launay, who drew a little apart as her brother, Sir Roger, approached, and
      respectfully bent his head in the Royal presence. For quite a minute he
      stood thus in dumb attention, his eyes lowered, while the Queen glanced at
      him with a curious expression, half of doubt, half of commiseration.
      Suddenly, as if moved by a quick impulse, she rose&mdash;a stately,
      exquisite figure, looking even more beautiful in her simple morning robe
      of white cashmere and lace, than in all the glory of her Court attire,&mdash;and
      extended her hand. Humbly and reverentially he bent over it, and kissed
      the great jewel sparkling like a star on the central finger. As he then
      raised his eyes to her face she smiled;&mdash;that smile of hers, so
      dazzling, so sweet, and yet so cold, had sent many men to their deaths,
      though she knew it not.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I see very little of you, Sir Roger," she said slowly, "notwithstanding
      your close attendance on my lord the King. Yet I know I can command your
      service!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Madam," murmured De Launay, "my life&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, no," she rejoined quickly, "not your life! Your life, like mine,
      belongs to the King and the country. You must give all, or not at all!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Madam, I do give all!" he answered, with a look in his eyes of mingled
      pain and passion; "No man can give more!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She surveyed him with a little meditative, almost amused air.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have strong feelings, Sir Roger," she said; "I wonder what it is like&mdash;to
      <i>feel</i>?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "If I may dare to say so, Madam, I should wish you to experience the
      sensation," he returned somewhat bitterly; "Sometimes we awaken to
      emotions too late&mdash;sometimes we never awaken. But I think it is
      wisest to experience the nature of a storm, in order to appreciate the
      value of a calm!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You think so?" She smiled indulgently. "Storm and calm are to me alike! I
      am affected by neither. Life is so exceedingly trivial an affair, and is
      so soon over, that I have never been able to understand why people should
      ever trouble themselves about anything in it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You may not always be lacking in this comprehension, Madam," said Sir
      Roger, with a certain harshness in his tone, yet with the deepest respect
      in his manner; "I take it that life and the world are but a preparation
      for something greater, and that we shall be forced to learn our lessons in
      this preparatory school before we leave it, whether we like it or no!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The slight smile still lingered on her beautiful mouth,&mdash;she pulled a
      spray of jasmine down from the trailing clusters around her, and set it
      carelessly among the folds of her lace. Sir Roger watched her with moody
      eyes. Could he have followed his own inclination, he would have snatched
      the flower from her dress and kissed it, in a kind of fierce defiance
      before her very eyes. But what would be the result of such an act? Merely
      a little contemptuous lifting of the delicate brows&mdash;a slight frown
      on the fair forehead, and a calm gesture of dismissal. No more&mdash;no
      more than this; for just as she could not be moved to love, neither could
      she be moved to anger. The words of an old song rang in his ears:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   She laughs at the thought of love&mdash;
  Pain she scorns, and sorrow she sets aside&mdash;
  My heart she values less than her broidered glove,
    She would smile if I died!
</pre>
    <p>
      "You are a man, Sir Roger de Launay," she said after a pause, "And
      man-like, you propound any theory which at the moment happens to fit your
      own particular humour. I am, however, entirely of your opinion that this
      life is only a term of preparation, and with this conviction I desire to
      have as little to do with its vile and ugly side as I can. It is possible
      to accept with gratitude the beautiful things of Nature, and reject the
      rest, is it not?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "As you ask me the question point-blank, Madam, I say it is possible,&mdash;it
      can be done,&mdash;and you do it. But it is wrong!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She raised her languid eyelids, showing no offence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wrong?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wrong, Madam!" repeated Sir Roger bluntly; "It is wrong to shut from your
      sight, from your heart, from your soul the ugly side of Nature;&mdash;to
      shut your ears to the wants&mdash;the pains&mdash;the tortures&mdash;the
      screams&mdash;the tears, and groans of humanity! Oh, Madam, the ugly side
      has a strange beauty of its own that you dream not of! God makes ugliness
      as he makes beauty; God created the volcano belching forth fire and molten
      lava, as He created the simple stream bordered with meadow flowers! Why
      should you reject the ugly, the fierce, the rebellious side of things?
      Rather take it into your gracious thoughts and prayers, Madam, and help to
      make it beautiful!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He spoke with a force which surprised himself&mdash;he was carried away by
      a passion that seemed almost outside his own identity. She looked at him
      curiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Does the King teach you to speak thus to me?" she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      De Launay started,&mdash;the hot colour mounting to his cheeks and brow.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Madam!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nay, no excuse! I understand! It is your own thought; but a thought which
      is no doubt suddenly inspired by the King's actions," she went on
      tranquilly; "You are in his confidence. He is adopting new measures of
      domestic policy, in which, perchance, I may or may not be included&mdash;as
      it suits my pleasure! Who knows!" Again the little musing smile crossed
      her countenance. "It is of the King I wish to speak to you."
    </p>
    <p>
      She glanced around her, and saw that her lady-in-waiting, Teresa de
      Launay, had discreetly wandered by herself to the edge of the water-lily
      pool, and was bending over it, a graceful, pensive figure in the near
      distance, within call, but certainly not within hearing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are in his confidence," she repeated, drawing a step nearer to him,
      "and&mdash;so am I! You will not disclose his movements&mdash;nor shall I!
      But you are his close attendant and friend,&mdash;I am merely&mdash;his
      wife! I make you responsible for his safety!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Madam, I pray you pardon me!" exclaimed De Launay; "His Majesty has a
      will of his own,&mdash;and his sacred life is not in my hands. I will
      defend him to the utmost limit of human possibility,&mdash;but if he
      voluntarily runs into danger, and disregards all warning, I, as his poor
      servant, am not to blame!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes, brilliant and full of a compelling magnetism, dwelt upon him
      steadfastly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I repeat my command," she said deliberately, "I make you responsible! You
      are a strong man and a brave one. If the King is rash, it is the duty of
      his servants to defend him from the consequences of his rashness;
      particularly if that rashness leads him into danger for a noble purpose.
      Should any mischance befall him, let me never see your face again! Die
      yourself, rather than let your King die!"
    </p>
    <p>
      As she spoke these words she motioned him away with a grand gesture of
      dismissal, and he retired back from her presence in a kind of stunned
      amazement. Never before in all the days of her social sway as
      Crown-Princess, had she ever condescended to speak to him on any matter of
      confidence,&mdash;never during her three years of sovereignty as
      Queen-Consort had she apparently taken note, or cared to know any of the
      affairs connected with the King, her husband. The mere fact that now her
      interest was roused, moved De Launay to speechless wonderment. He hardly
      dared raise his eyes to look at her, as she turned from him and went
      slowly, with her usual noiseless, floating grace of movement, towards the
      water-lily pool, there to rejoin her attendant, Teresa de Launay, who at
      the same time advanced to meet her Royal mistress. A moment more, and
      Queen and lady of honour had disappeared together, and De Launay was left
      alone. A little bird, swinging on a branch above his head, piped a few
      tender notes to the green leaves and the sunlit sky, but beyond this, and
      the measured plash of the fountain, no sound disturbed the stillness of
      the garden.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Upon my word, Roger de Launay," he said bitterly to himself, "you are an
      ass sufficiently weighted with burdens! The love of a Queen, and the life
      of a King are enough for one man's mind to carry with any degree of
      safety! If it were not for the King, I think I should leave this country
      and seek some other service&mdash;but I owe him much,&mdash;if only by
      reason of my own heart's folly!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Impatient with himself, he strode away, straight across the lawn and back
      to the palace. Here he noticed just the slightest atmosphere of uneasiness
      among some of the retainers of the Royal household,&mdash;a vague
      impression of flurry and confusion. Through various passages and
      corridors, attendants and pages were either running about with extra
      haste, or else strolling to and fro with extra slowness. As he turned into
      one of the ante-chambers, he suddenly confronted a tall, military-looking
      personage in plain civilian attire, whom he at once recognized as the
      Chief of the Police.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, Bernhoff!" he said lightly, "any storms brewing?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "None that call for particular attention, Sir Roger," replied the
      individual addressed; "But I have been sent for by the King, and am here
      awaiting his pleasure."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Roger showed no sign of surprise, and with a friendly nod passed on.
      He began to find the situation rather interesting.
    </p>
    <p>
      "After all," he argued inwardly, "there is nothing to hinder the King from
      being a social autocrat, even if he cannot by the rules of the
      Constitution be a political one. And we should do well to remember that
      politics are governed entirely by social influence. It is the same thing
      all over the world&mdash;a deluded populace&mdash;a social movement which
      elects a parliament and ministry&mdash;and then the result,&mdash;which
      is, that this or that party hold the reins of government, on whichever
      side happens to be most advantageous to the immediate social and financial
      whim. The people are the grapes crushed into wine for their rulers'
      drinking; and the King is merely the wine-cup on the festal board. If he
      once begins to be something more than that cup, there will be an end of
      revelry!"
    </p>
    <p>
      His ideas were not without good foundation in fact. Throughout all
      history, where a strong man has ruled a nation, whether for good or ill,
      he has left his mark; and where there has been no strong man, the annals
      of the time are vapid and uninteresting. Governments emanate from social
      influences. The social rule of the Roman Emperors bred athletes, heroes,
      and poets, merely because physical strength and courage, combined with
      heroism and poetic perception were encouraged by Roman society. The social
      rule of England's Elizabeth had its result in the brilliant attainments of
      the many great men who crowded her Court&mdash;the social rule of
      Victoria, until the death of the Prince Consort, bred gentle women and
      chivalrous men. In all these cases, the reigning monarchs governed
      society, and society governed politics. Politics, indeed, can scarcely be
      considered apart from society, because on the nature and character of
      society depend the nature and character of politics. If society is made up
      of corrupt women and unprincipled men, the spirit of political government
      will be as corrupt and unprincipled as they. If any King, beholding such a
      state of things, were to suddenly cut himself clear of the corruption, and
      to make a straight road for his own progress&mdash;clean and open&mdash;and
      elect to walk in it, society would follow his lead, and as a logical
      consequence politics would become honourable. But no monarchs have the
      courage of their opinions nowadays,&mdash;if only one sovereign of them
      all possessed such courage, he could move the world!
    </p>
    <p>
      The long bright day unwound its sunny hours, crowned with blue skies and
      fragrant winds, and the life and movement of the fair city by the sea was
      gay, incessant and ever-changing. There was some popular interest and
      excitement going on down at the quay, for the usual idle crowd had
      collected to see the Royal yacht being prepared for her afternoon's
      cruise. Though she was always kept ready for sailing, the King's orders
      this time had been sudden and peremptory, and, consequently, all the men
      on board were exceptionally hard at work getting things in immediate
      readiness. The fact that the Queen was to accompany the King in the
      afternoon's trip to The Islands, where up to the present she had never
      been, was a matter of lively comment,&mdash;her extraordinary beauty never
      failing to attract a large number of sight-seers.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the general excitement, no one saw Professor von Glauben quietly enter
      a small and common sailing skiff, manned by two ordinary fishermen of the
      shore, and scud away with the wind over the sea towards the west, where,
      in the distance on this clear day, a gleaming line of light showed where
      The Islands lay, glistening like emerald and pearl in the midst of the
      dark blue waste of water. His departure was unnoticed, though as a rule
      the King's private physician commanded some attention, not only by reason
      of his confidential post in the Royal household, but also on account of
      certain rumours which were circulated through the country concerning his
      wonderful skill in effecting complete cures where all hope of recovery had
      been abandoned. It was whispered, indeed, that he had discovered the
      'Elixir of Life,' but that he would not allow its properties to be made
      known, lest as the Scripture saith, man should 'take and eat and live for
      ever.' It was not advisable&mdash;so the Professor was reported to have
      said&mdash;that all men should live for ever,&mdash;but only a chosen few;
      and he, at present, was apparently the privileged person who alone was
      fitted to make the selection of those few. For this and various other
      reasons, he was generally looked at with considerable interest, but this
      morning, owing to the hurried preparations for the embarking of their
      Majesties on board the Royal yacht, he managed to escape from even chance
      recognition,&mdash;and he was well over the sea, and more than half-way to
      his destination before the bells of the city struck noon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Punctual to that hour, a close carriage drove up to the palace. It
      contained no less a personage than the Prime Minister, the Marquis de
      Lutera,&mdash;a dark, heavy man, with small furtive eyes, a ponderous jaw,
      and a curious air of seeming for ever on an irritable watch for offences.
      His aspect was intellectual, yet always threatening; and his frigid manner
      was profoundly discouraging to all who sought to win his attention or
      sympathy. He entered the palace now with an easy, not to say assertive
      deportment, and as he ascended the broad staircase which led to the King's
      private apartments, he met the Chief of the Police coming down. This
      latter saluted him, but he barely acknowledged the courtesy, so taken by
      surprise was he at the sight of this administrative functionary in the
      palace at so early an hour. However, it was impossible to ask any
      questions of him on the grand staircase, within hearing of the Royal
      lackeys; so he continued on his way upstairs, with as much dignity as his
      heavily-moulded figure would permit him to display, till he reached the
      upper landing known as the 'King's Corridor,' where Sir Roger de Launay
      was in waiting to conduct him to his sovereign's presence. To him the
      Marquis addressed the question:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bernhoff has been with the King?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. For more than an hour."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Any robbery in the palace?"
    </p>
    <p>
      De Launay smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think not! So far as I am permitted to be cognisant of events, there is
      nothing wrong!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The Marquis looked slightly perplexed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The King is well?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Remarkably well&mdash;and in excellent humour! He is awaiting you,
      Marquis,&mdash;permit me to escort you to him!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The carved and gilded doors of the Royal audience-chamber were thereupon
      flung back, and the Marquis entered, ushered in by De Launay. The doors
      closed again upon them both; and for some time there was profound silence
      in the King's corridor, no intruder venturing to approach save two
      gentlemen-at-arms, who paced slowly up and down at either end on guard. At
      the expiration of about an hour, Sir Roger came out alone, and, glancing
      carelessly around him, strolled to the head of the grand staircase, and
      waited patiently there for quite another thirty minutes. At last the doors
      were flung open widely again, and the King himself appeared, clad in easy
      yachting attire, and walking with one hand resting on the arm of the
      Marquis de Lutera, who, from his expression, seemed curiously perturbed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then you will not come with us, Marquis?" said the King, with an air of
      gaiety; "You are too much engrossed in the affairs of Government to break
      loose for an afternoon from politics for the sake of pleasure? Ah, well!
      You are a matchless worker! Renowned as you are for your studious
      observation of all that may tend to the advancement of the nation's
      interests&mdash;admired as you are for the complete sacrifice of all your
      own advantages to the better welfare of the country, I will not (though I
      might as your sovereign), command your attendance on this occasion! I know
      the affairs you have in hand are pressing and serious!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "They will be more than usually so, Sir," said the Marquis in a low voice;
      "for if you persist in maintaining your present attitude, the foreign
      controversy in which we are engaged can scarcely go on. But your action
      will be questioned by the Government!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The King laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good! By all means question it, my dear Marquis! Prove me an
      unconstitutional monarch, if you like, and put Humphry on the throne in my
      place,&mdash;but ask the People first! If they condemn me, I am satisfied
      to be condemned! But the present political difference between ourselves
      and a friendly nation must be arranged without offence. There does not
      exist at the moment any reasonable cause for fanning the dispute into a
      flame of war."&mdash;He paused, then resumed&mdash;"You will not come with
      us?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sir, if you will permit me to refuse the honour on this occasion&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The permission is granted!" replied the King, still smiling; "Farewell,
      Marquis! We are not in the habit of absenting ourselves from our own
      country, after the fashion of certain of our Royal neighbours, who shall
      be nameless; and we conceive it our duty to make ourselves acquainted with
      the habits and customs of all our subjects in all quarters of our realm.
      Hence our resolve to visit The Islands, which, to our shame be it said, we
      have neglected until now. We expect to derive both pleasure and
      instruction from the brief voyage!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are the islanders aware of your intention, Sir?" enquired the Marquis.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nay&mdash;to prepare them would have spoilt our pleasure!" replied the
      King. "We will take them by surprise! We have heard of certain countries,
      whose villages and towns have never seen the reigning sovereign,&mdash;and
      though we have been but three years on the throne, we have resolved that
      no corner of our kingdom shall lack the sunlight of our presence!" He gave
      a mirthful side-glance at De Launay. Then, extending his hand cordially,
      he added: "May all success attend your efforts, Marquis, to smooth over
      this looming quarrel between ourselves and our friendly trade-rivals! I,
      for one, would not have it go further. I shall see you again at the
      Council during the week."
    </p>
    <p>
      As the premier's hand met that of his Sovereign, the latter exclaimed
      suddenly:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah!&mdash;I thought I missed a customary friend from my finger; I have
      forgotten my signet-ring! Will you lend me yours for to-day, Marquis?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sir, if you will deign to wear it!" replied the Marquis readily, and at
      once slipping off the ring in question, he handed it to the King, who
      smilingly accepted it and put it on.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A fine sapphire!" he said approvingly; "Better, I think, than my ruby!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sir, your praise enhances its value," said De Lutera bowing profoundly;
      "I shall from henceforth esteem it priceless!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well said!" returned the King, "And rightly too!&mdash;for diplomacy is
      wise in flattering a king to the last, even while meditating on his
      possible downfall! Adieu, Marquis! When we next meet, I shall expect good
      news!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He descended the staircase, closely attended by De Launay, and passed at
      once into a larger room of audience, where some notable persons of foreign
      distinction were waiting to be received. On the way thither, however, he
      turned to Sir Roger for a moment, and held up the hand on which the
      Marquis de Lutera's signet flashed like a blue point of flame.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Behold the Premier's signet!" he said with a smile; "Methinks, for once,
      it suits the King!"

    <h2>
      CHAPTER X. &mdash; THE ISLANDS
    </h2>
    <p>
      Surrounded by a boundless width of dark blue sea at all visible points of
      view, The Islands, lovely tufts of wooded rock, trees, and full-flowering
      meadowlands, were situated in such a happy position as to be well out of
      all possibility of modern innovation or improvement. They were too small
      to contain much attraction for the curious tourist; and though they were
      only a two-hours' sail from the mainland, the distance was just
      sufficiently inconvenient to keep mere sight-seers away. For more than a
      hundred years they had been almost exclusively left to the coral-fishers,
      who had made their habitation there; and the quaint, small houses, and
      flowering vineyards and gardens, dotted about in the more fertile portions
      of the soil, had all been built and planned by a former race of these
      hardy folk, who had handed their properties down from father to son. They
      were on the whole, a peaceable community. Coral-fishing was one of the
      chief industries of the country, and the islanders passed all their days
      in obtaining the precious product, cleansing, and preparing it for the
      market. They were understood to be extremely jealous of strangers and
      intruders, and to hold certain social traditions which had never been
      questioned or interfered with by any form of existing government, because
      in themselves they gave no cause for interference, being counted among the
      most orderly and law-abiding subjects of the realm. Very little interest
      was taken in their doings by the people of the mainland,&mdash;scarcely as
      much interest, perhaps, as is taken by Londoners in the inhabitants of
      Orkney or Shetland. One or two scholars, a stray botanist here and there,
      or a few students fond of adventure, had visited the place now and again,
      and some of these had brought back enthusiastic accounts of the loveliness
      of the natural scenery, but where a whole country is beautiful, little
      heed is given to one small corner of it, particularly if that corner is
      difficult of access, necessitating a two hours' sail across a not always
      calm sea. Vague reports were current that there was a strange house on The
      Islands, built very curiously out of the timbers and spars of wrecked
      vessels. The owner of this abode was said to be a man of advanced age,
      whose history was unknown, but who many years ago had been cast ashore
      from a great shipwreck, and had been rescued and revived by the
      coral-fishers, since when, he had lived among them, and worked with them.
      No one knew anything about him beyond that since his advent The Islands
      had been more cultivated, and their inhabitants more prosperous; and that
      he was understood to be, in the language or dialect of the country, a
      'life-philosopher.' Whereat, hearing these things by chance now and then,
      or seeing a scrappy line or two in the daily press when active reporters
      had no murders or suicides to enlarge upon, and wanted to 'fill up space,'
      the gay aristocrats or 'smart set' of the metropolis laughed at their
      dinner-parties and balls, and asked one another inanely, "What is a
      'life-philosopher'?"
    </p>
    <p>
      In the same way, when a small volume of poetry, burning as lava, wild as a
      storm-wind, came floating out on the top of the seething soup of current
      literature, bearing the name of Paul Zouche, and it was said that this
      person was a poet, they questioned smilingly, "Is he dead?" for,
      naturally, they could not imagine these modern days were capable of giving
      birth to a living specimen of the <i>genus</i> bard. For they, too, had
      their motor-cars from France and England;&mdash;they, too, had their
      gambling-dens secreted in private houses of high repute,&mdash;they, too,
      had their country-seats specially indicated as free to such house-parties
      as wished to indulge in low intrigue and unbridled licentiousness; they,
      too, weary of simple Christianity, had their own special 'religions' of
      palmistry, crystal-gazing, fortune-telling by cards, and Esoteric
      'faith-healing.' The days were passing with them&mdash;as it passes with
      many of their 'set' in other countries,&mdash;in complete forgetfulness of
      all the nobler ambitions and emotions which lift Man above the level of
      his companion Beast. For the time is now upon us when what has formerly
      been known as 'high' is of its own accord sinking to the low, and what has
      been called the 'low' is rising to the high. Strange times!&mdash;strange
      days!&mdash;when the tradesman can scorn the duchess on account of her
      'dirty mind'&mdash;when a certain nobleman can get no honest labourers to
      work on his estate, because they suspect him of 'rooking' young college
      lads;&mdash;and when a church in a seaport town stands empty every Sunday,
      with its bells ringing in vain, because the congregation which should fill
      it, know that their so-called 'holy man' is a rascal! All over the world
      this rebellion against Falsehood,&mdash;this movement towards Truth is
      felt,&mdash;all over the world the people are growing strong on their
      legs, and clear in their brains;&mdash;no longer cramped and stunted
      starvelings, they are gradually developing into full growth, and awaking
      to intelligent action. And wherever the dominion of priestcraft has been
      destroyed, there they are found at their best and bravest, with a
      glimmering dawn of the true Christian spirit beginning to lighten their
      darkness,&mdash;a spirit which has no race or sect, but is all-embracing,
      all-loving, and all-benevolent;&mdash;which 'thinketh no evil,' but is so
      nobly sufficing in its tenderness and patience, as to persuade the
      obstinate, govern the unruly, and recover the lost, by the patient
      influence of its own example. On the reverse side of the medal, wherever
      we see priestcraft dominant, there we see ignorance and corruption, vice
      and hypocrisy, and such a low standard of morals and education as is
      calculated to keep the soul a slave in irons, with no possibility of any
      intellectual escape into the 'glorious liberty of the free.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The afternoon was one of exceptional brilliance and freshness, when,
      punctually at three o'clock, the Royal yacht hoisted sail, and dipped
      gracefully away from the quay with their Majesties on board, amid the
      cheers of an enthusiastic crowd. A poet might have sung of the scene in
      fervid rhyme, so pretty and gay were all the surroundings,&mdash;the
      bright skies, the dancing sea, the flying flags and streamers, and the
      soft music of the Court orchestra, a band of eight players on stringed
      instruments, which accompanied the Royal party on their voyage of
      pleasure. The Queen stood on deck, leaning against the mast, her eyes
      fixed on the shore, as the vessel swung round, and bore away towards the
      west;&mdash;the people, elbowing each other, and climbing up on each
      other's shoulders and on the posts of the quay, merely to get a passing
      glimpse of her beauty, all loyally cheering and waving their hats and
      handkerchiefs, were as indifferent to her sight and soul as an ant-heap in
      a garden walk. She had accustomed her mind to dwell on things beyond life,
      and life itself had little interest for her. This was because she had been
      set among the shams of worldly state and ceremonial from her earliest
      years, and being of a profound and thoughtful nature, had grown up to
      utterly despise the hollowness and hypocrisy of her surroundings. In
      extenuation of the coldness of her temperament, it may be said that her
      rooted aversion to men arose from having studied them too closely and
      accurately. In her marriage she had fulfilled, or thought she had
      fulfilled, a mere duty to the State&mdash;no more; and the easy conduct of
      her husband during his apprenticeship to the throne as Heir-Apparent, had
      not tended in any way to show her anything particularly worthy of
      admiration or respect in his character. And so she had gone on her chosen
      way, removed and apart from his,&mdash;and the years had flown by, and now
      she was,&mdash;as she said to herself with a little touch of contempt,&mdash;'old&mdash;for
      a woman!'&mdash;while the King remained 'young,&mdash;for a man! 'This was
      a mortifying reflection. True, her beauty was more perfect than in her
      youth, and there were no signs as yet of its decay. She knew well enough
      the extent of her charm,&mdash;she knew how easily she could command
      homage wherever she went,&mdash;and knowing, she did not care. Or rather&mdash;she
      had not cared. Was it possible she would ever care, and perhaps at a time
      when it was no use caring? A certain irritability, quite foreign to her
      usual composure, fevered her blood, and it arose from one simple admission
      which she had been forced to make to herself within the last few days, and
      this was, that her husband was as much her kingly superior in heart and
      mind as he was in rank and power. She had never till now imagined him
      capable of performing a brave deed, or pursuing an independently noble
      course of action. Throughout all the days of his married life he had
      followed the ordinary routine of his business or pleasure with scarce a
      break,&mdash;in winter to his country seat on the most southern coast of
      his southern land,&mdash;in spring to the capital,&mdash;in full summer to
      some fashionable 'bath' or 'cure,'&mdash;in autumn to different great
      houses for the purpose of shooting other people's game by their obsequious
      invitation,&mdash;and in the entire round he had never shown himself
      capable of much more than a flirtation with the prettiest or the most
      pushing new beauty, or a daring ride on the latest invention for
      travelling at lightning speed. She had noticed a certain change in him
      since he had ascended the throne, but she had attributed this to the
      excessive boredom of having to attend to State affairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, however, all at once and without warning, this change had developed
      into what was evidently likely to prove a complete transformation&mdash;and
      he had surprised her into an involuntary, and more or less reluctant
      admiration of qualities which she had never hitherto suspected in him. She
      had consented to join him on this occasion in his trip to The Islands, in
      order to try and fathom the actual drift of his intentions,&mdash;for his
      idea that their son, Prince Humphry, had yielded to some particular
      feminine attraction there, piqued her curiosity even more than her
      interest. She turned away now from her observation of the shore, as it
      receded on the horizon and became a mere thin line of light which vanished
      in its turn as the vessel curtsied onward; and she moved to the place
      prepared for her accommodation&mdash;a sheltered corner of the deck,
      covered by silken awnings, and supplied with luxurious deck chairs and
      footstools. Here two of her ladies were waiting to attend upon her, but
      none of the rougher sex she so heartily abhorred. As she seated herself
      among her cushions with her usual indolent grace, she raised her eyes and
      saw, standing at a respectful distance from her, a distinguished personage
      who had but lately arrived at the Court, from England,&mdash;Sir Walter
      Langton, a daring traveller and explorer in far countries,&mdash;one who
      had earned high distinction at the point of the sword. He had been
      presented to her some evenings since, among a crowd of other notabilities,
      and she had, as was her usual custom with all men, scarcely given him a
      passing glance. Now as she regarded him, she suddenly decided, out of the
      merest whim, to call him to her side. She sent one of her ladies to him,
      charged with her invitation to approach and take his seat near her. He
      hastened to obey, with some surprise, and no little pleasure. He was a
      handsome man of about forty, sun-browned and keen of eye, with a grave
      intellectual face after the style of a Vandyk portrait, and a kindly
      smile; and he was happily devoid of all that unbecoming officiousness and
      obsequiousness which some persons affect when in the presence of Royalty.
      He bowed profoundly as the Queen received him, saying to him with a smile:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are a stranger here, Sir Walter Langton!&mdash;I cannot allow you to
      feel solitary in our company!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is it possible for anyone to feel solitary when you are near, Madam?"
      returned Sir Walter gallantly, as he obeyed the gesture with which she
      motioned him to be seated;&mdash;"You must be weary of hearing that even
      your silent presence is sufficient to fill space with melody and charm!
      And I am not altogether a stranger; I know this country well, though I
      have never till now had the honour of visiting its ruling sovereign."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is very unlike England," said the Queen, slowly unfurling her fan of
      soft white plumage and waving it to and fro.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very unlike, indeed!" he agreed, and a musing tenderness darkened his
      fine hazel eyes as he gazed out on the sparkling sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You like England best?" resumed the Queen.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Madam, I am an Englishman! To me there is no land so fair, or so much
      worth living and dying for, as England!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yet&mdash;I suppose, like all your countrymen, you are fond of change?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes&mdash;and no, Madam!" replied Langton.&mdash;"In truth, if I am to
      speak frankly, it is only during the last thirty or forty years that my
      countrymen have blotted their historical scutcheons by this fondness for
      change. Where travelling is necessary for the attainment of some worthy
      object, then it is wise and excellent,&mdash;but where it is only for the
      purpose of distracting a self-satiated mind, it is of no avail, and indeed
      frequently does more harm than good."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Self-satiated!" repeated the Queen,&mdash;"Is not that a strange word?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is the only compound expression I can use to describe the discontented
      humour in which the upper classes of English society exist to-day,"
      replied Sir Walter. "For many years the soul of England has been held in
      chains by men whose thoughts are all of Self,&mdash;the honour of England
      has been attainted by women whose lives are moulded from first to last on
      Self. To me, personally, England is everything,&mdash;I have no thought
      outside it&mdash;no wish beyond it. Yet I am as ashamed of some of its
      leaders of opinion to-day, as if I saw my own mother dragged in the dust
      and branded with infamy!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You speak of your Government?" began the Queen.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, Madam,&mdash;I have no more quarrel with my country's present
      Government than I could have with a child who is led into a ditch by its
      nurse. It is a weak and corrupted Government; and its actual rulers are
      vile and abandoned women."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Queen's eyes opened in a beautiful, startled wonderment;&mdash;this
      man's clear, incisive manner of speech interested her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Women!" she echoed, then smiled; "You speak strongly, Sir Walter! I have
      certainly heard of the 'advanced' women who push themselves so much
      forward in your country, but I had no idea they were so mischievous! Are
      they to be admired? Or pitied?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pitied, Madam,&mdash;most sincerely pitied!" returned Sir Walter;&mdash;"But
      such misguided simpletons as these are not the creatures who rule, or play
      with, or poison the minds of the various members who compose our
      Government. The 'advanced' women, poor souls, do nothing but talk
      platitudes. They are perfectly harmless. They have no power to persuade
      men, because in nine cases out of ten, they have neither wit nor beauty.
      And without either of these two charms, Madam, it is difficult to put even
      a clever cobbler, much less a Prime Minister, into leading strings! No,&mdash;it
      is the spendthrift women of a corrupt society that I mean,&mdash;the women
      who possess beauty, and are conscious of it,&mdash;the women who have a
      mordant wit and use it for dangerous purposes&mdash;the women who give up
      their homes, their husbands, their children and their reputations for the
      sake of villainous intrigue, and the feverish excitement of speculative
      money-making;&mdash;with these&mdash;and with the stealthy spread of
      Romanism,&mdash;will come the ruin of my country!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "So grave as all that!" said the Queen lightly;&mdash;"But, surely, Sir
      Walter, if you see ruin and disaster threatening so great an Empire in the
      far distance, you and other wise men of your land are able to stave it
      off?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Madam, I have no power!" he returned bitterly. "Those who have thought
      and worked,&mdash;those who are able to see what is coming by the light of
      past experience, are seldom listened to, or if they get a hearing, they
      are not seldom ridiculed and 'laughed down.' Till a strong man speaks, we
      must all remain dumb. There is no real Government in England at present,
      just as there is no real Church. The Government is made up of directly
      self-interested speculators and financiers rather than diplomatists,&mdash;the
      Church, for which our forefathers fought, is yielding to the bribery of
      Rome. It is a time of Sham,&mdash;sham politics, and sham religion! We
      have fallen upon evil days,&mdash;and unless the people rise, as it is to
      be hoped to God they will, serious danger threatens the glory and the
      honour of England!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Would you desire revolution and bloodshed, then?" enquired the Queen,
      becoming more and more interested as she saw that this Englishman did not,
      like most of his sex, pass the moments in gazing at her in speechless
      admiration,&mdash;"Surely not!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I would have revolution, Madam, but not bloodshed," he replied;&mdash;"I
      think my countrymen are too well grounded in common-sense to care for any
      movement which could bring about internal dissension or riot,&mdash;but,
      at the same time, I believe their native sense of justice is great enough
      to resist tyranny and wrong and falsehood, even to the death. I would have
      a revolution&mdash;yes&mdash;but a silent and bloodless one!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And how would you begin?" asked the Queen.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The People must begin, Madam!" he answered;&mdash;"All reforms must begin
      and end with the People only! For example, if the People would decline to
      attend any church where the incumbent is known to encourage practices
      which are disloyal to the faith of the land, such disloyalty would soon
      cease. If the majority of women would refuse to know, or to receive, any
      woman of high position who had voluntarily disgraced herself, they would
      soon put a stop to the lax morality of the upper classes. If our builders,
      artisans and mechanics would club together, and refuse to make guns or
      ships for our enemies in foreign countries, we should not run the risk of
      being one day hoisted with our own petard. In any case, the work of
      Revolution rests with the people, though it is quite true they need
      teachers to show them how to begin."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And are these teachers forthcoming?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think so!" said Sir Walter meditatively. "Throughout all history, as
      far back as we can trace it, whenever a serious reform has been needed in
      either society or government, there has always been found a leader to head
      the movement."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Queen's beautiful eyes rested upon him with a certain curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What of your King?" she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Madam, he is my King!" he replied,&mdash;"And I serve him faithfully!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She was silent. She began to wonder whether he had any private motive to
      gain, any place he sought to fill, that he should assume such a
      touch-me-not air at this stray allusion to his Sovereign.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lèse-majesté is so common nowadays!" she mused;&mdash;"It is such an
      ordinary thing to hear vulgar <i>parvenus</i> talk of their king as if he
      were a public-house companion of theirs, that it is somewhat remarkable to
      find one who speaks of his monarch with loyalty and respect. I suppose,
      however, like everyone else, he has his own ends to serve!&mdash;Kings are
      the last persons in the world who can command absolute fidelity!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She glanced dreamily over the sea, and perceiving a slight shade of
      weariness on her face, Sir Walter discreetly rose, craving her permission
      to retire to the saloon, where he had promised to join the King. When he
      had left her, she turned to one of her ladies, the Countess Amabil, and
      remarked:
    </p>
    <p>
      "A very personable gentleman, is he not?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Madam," rejoined the Countess, who was very lovely in herself, and of a
      bright and sociable disposition;&mdash;"I have often thought it would be
      more pleasant and profitable for all of us if we had many such personable
      gentlemen with us oftener!"
    </p>
    <p>
      A slight frown of annoyance crossed the Queen's face. The Countess was a
      very charming lady; very fascinating in her own way, but her decided
      predilection for the sterner sex often led her to touch on dangerous
      ground with her Royal mistress. This time, however, she escaped the
      chilling retort her remark might possibly, on another occasion, have
      called down upon her. The Queen said nothing. She sat watching the sea,&mdash;and
      now and again took up her field-glass to study the picturesque coast of
      The Islands, which was rapidly coming into view. Teresa de Launay, the
      second lady in attendance on her, was reading, and, seeing her quite
      absorbed in her book, the Queen presently asked her what it contained.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have smiled twice over that book, Teresa," she said kindly;&mdash;"What
      is it about?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Madam, it speaks of love!" replied Teresa, still smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And love makes you smile?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I would rather smile than weep over it, Madam!" replied Teresa, with a
      slight colour warming her fair face;&mdash;"But as concerns this book, I
      smile, because it is full of such foolish verses,&mdash;as light and sweet&mdash;and
      almost as cloying,&mdash;as French <i>fondants</i>!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let me hear!" said the Queen; "Read me a few lines."
    </p>
    <p>
      "This one, called 'A Canzonet' is brief enough for your Majesty's
      immediate consideration," replied Teresa;&mdash;"It is just such a thing
      as a man might scribble in his note-book after a bout of champagne, when
      he is in love for ten minutes! He would not mean a word of it,&mdash;but
      it might sound pretty by moonlight!" Whereupon she read aloud:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
 My Lady is pleased to smile,
    And the world is glad and gay;
  My Lady is pleased to weep;&mdash;
    And it rains the livelong day!

  My Lady is pleased to hate,
    And I lose my life and my breath;
  My Lady is pleased to love,&mdash;
    And I am the master of Death!

  I know that my Lady is Love,
    By the magical light about her;
  I know that my Lady is Life,
    For I cannot live without her!
</pre>
    <p>
      "And you do not think any man would truly mean as much love as this?"
      queried the Queen.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Madam, you know he would not! If he had written such lines about the
      joys of dining, or the flavour of an excellent cigar, they might then
      indeed be taken as an expression of his truest and deepest feeling! But
      his 'Lady'! Bah! She is a mere myth,&mdash;a temporary peg to hang a stray
      emotion on!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She laughed, and her laughter rippled merrily on the air.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do not think the men who write so easily about love can ever truly feel
      it," she went on;&mdash;"Those who really love must surely be quite unable
      to express themselves. This man who sings about his 'Lady' being pleased
      to do this or do that, was probably trying to obtain the good graces of
      some pretty housemaid or chorus girl!"
    </p>
    <p>
      A slight contemptuous smile crossed the Queen's face; from her expression
      it was evident that she agreed in the main with the opinion of her
      vivacious lady-in-waiting. Just at that moment the King and his suite,
      with Sir Walter Langton and one or two other gentlemen, who had been
      invited to join the party, came up from the saloon, and the conversation
      became general.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you seen Humphry at all to-day?" enquired the King aside of De
      Launay. "I sent him an early message asking him to join us, and was told
      he had gone out riding. Is that true?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have not seen his Royal Highness since the morning, Sir," replied the
      equerry; "He then met me,&mdash;and Professor von Glauben also&mdash;in
      the gardens. He gave me no hint as to whether he knew of your intention to
      sail to The Islands this afternoon or not; he was reading, and with some
      slight discussion on the subject of the book he was interested in, he and
      the Professor strolled away together."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But where is Von Glauben?" pursued the King; "I sent for him likewise,
      but he was absent."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I understood him to say that you had not commanded his attendance again
      to-day, Sir," replied Sir Roger;&mdash;"He told me he had already waited
      upon you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly I did not command his attendance when I saw him the first thing
      this morning," replied the King; "I summoned him then merely to satisfy
      his scruples concerning my health and safety, as he seemed last night to
      have doubts of both!" He smiled, and his eyes twinkled humourously. "Later
      on, I requested him to join us in this excursion, but his servant said he
      had gone out, leaving no word as to when he would return. An eccentricity!
      I suppose he must be humoured!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Roger was silent. The King looked at him narrowly, and saw that there
      was something in his thoughts which he was not inclined to utter, and with
      wise tact and discretion forbore to press any more questions upon him. It
      was not a suitable time for cross-examination, even of the most friendly
      kind; there were too many persons near at hand who might be disposed to
      listen and to form conjectures; moreover the favouring wind had so aided
      the Royal yacht in her swift course that The Islands were now close at
      hand, and the harbour visible, the run across from the mainland having
      been accomplished under the usual two hours.
    </p>
    <p>
      The King scanned the coast through his glass with some interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We shall obtain amusement from this unprepared trip," he said, addressing
      the friends who were gathered round him; "We have forbidden any
      announcement of our visit here, and, therefore, we shall receive no
      recognition, or welcome. We shall have to take the people as we find
      them!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let us hope they will prove themselves agreeable, Sir," said one of the
      suite, the Marquis Montala, a somewhat effeminate elegant-looking man,
      with small delicate features and lazily amorous eyes,&mdash;"And that the
      women of the place will not be too alarmingly hideous."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Women are always women." said the King gaily; "And you, Montala, if you
      cannot find a pretty one, will put up with an ugly one for the moment
      rather than have none at all! But beauty exists everywhere, and I daresay
      we shall find it in as good evidence here as in other parts of the
      kingdom. Our land is famous for its lovely women,"&mdash;and turning to
      Sir Walter Langton he added&mdash;"I think, Sir Walter, we can almost beat
      your England in that one particular!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Some years ago, Sir, I should have accepted that challenge," returned Sir
      Walter, "And with the deepest respect for your Majesty, I should have
      ventured to deny the assertion that any country in the world could surpass
      England for the beauty of its women. But since the rage for masculine
      sports and masculine manners has taken hold of English girls, I am not at
      all disposed to defend them. They have, unhappily, lost all the soft grace
      and modesty for which their grandmothers were renowned, and one begins to
      remark that their very shapes are no longer feminine. The beautiful full
      bosoms, admired by Gainsborough and Romney, are replaced by an unbecoming
      flatness&mdash;the feet and hands are growing large and awkward, instead
      of being well-shaped, white and delicate&mdash;the skin is becoming coarse
      and rough of texture, and there is very little complexion to boast of, if
      we except the artificial make-up of the women of the town. Some few pretty
      and natural women remain in the heart of the forest and the country, but
      the contamination is spreading, and English women are no longer the models
      of womanhood for all the world."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you married, Sir Walter?" asked the King with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      "To no woman, Sir! I have married England&mdash;I love her and work for
      her only!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You find that love sufficient to fill your heart?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps," returned Sir Walter musingly&mdash;"perhaps if I speak
      personally and selfishly&mdash;no! But when I argue the point logically, I
      find this&mdash;that if I had a wife she might probably occupy too much of
      my time,&mdash;certes, if I had children, I should be working for them and
      their future welfare;&mdash;as it is, I give all my life and all my work
      to my country, and my King!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hope you will meet with the reward you merit," said the Queen gently;
      "Kings are not always well served!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I seek no reward," said Sir Walter simply; "The joy of work is always its
      own guerdon."
    </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke the yacht ran into harbour, and with a loud warning cry the
      sailors flung out the first rope to a man on the pier, who stood gazing in
      open-mouthed wonder at their arrival. He seemed too stricken with
      amazement to move, for he failed to seize the rope, whereat, with an angry
      exclamation as the rope slipped back into the water, and the yacht bumped
      against the pier, a sailor sprang to land, and as it was thrown a second
      time, seized it and made it fast to the capstan. A few more moments and
      the yacht was safely alongside, the native islander remaining still
      motionless and staring. The captain of the Royal vessel stepped on shore
      and spoke to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are there any men about here?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The individual thus addressed shook his head in the negative.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you alone to keep the pier?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The head nodded in the affirmative. A voice, emanating from a thickly
      bearded mouth was understood to growl forth something about 'no strange
      boats being permitted to harbour there.' Whereupon the Captain walked up
      to the uncouth-looking figure, and said briefly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We are here by the King's order! That vessel is the Royal yacht, and
      their Majesties are on board."
    </p>
    <p>
      For one instant the islander stared more wildly than ever, then with a cry
      of amazement and evident alarm, ran away as fast as his legs could carry
      him and disappeared. The captain returned to the yacht and related his
      experience to Sir Roger de Launay. The King heard and was amused.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It seems, Madam," he said, turning to the Queen, "That we shall have The
      Islands to ourselves; but as our visit will be but brief, we shall no
      doubt find enough to interest us in the mere contemplation of the scenery
      without other human company than our own. Will you come?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He extended his hand courteously to assist her across the gangway of the
      vessel, and in a few minutes the Royal party were landed, and the yacht
      was left to the stewards and servants, who soon had all hands at work
      preparing the dinner which was to be served during the return sail.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XI. &mdash; "GLORIA&mdash;IN EXCELSIS!"
    </h2>
    <p>
      The King and Queen, followed by their suite and their guests, walked
      leisurely off the pier, and down a well-made road, sparkling with crushed
      sea-shells and powdered coral, towards a group of tall trees and green
      grass which they perceived a little way ahead of them. There was a
      soothing quietness everywhere,&mdash;save for the singing of birds and the
      soft ripple of the waves on the sandy shore, it was a silent land:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    "In which it seemed always afternoon&mdash;
    All round the coast the languid air did swoon&mdash;
    Breathing like one that hath a weary dream."
</pre>
    <p>
      The Queen paused once or twice to look around her; she was vaguely touched
      and charmed by the still beauty of the scene.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is very lovely!" she said, more to herself than to any of her
      companions; "The world must have looked something like this in the first
      days of creation,&mdash;so unspoilt and fresh and simple!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The Countess Amabil, walking with Sir Walter Langton, glanced coquettishly
      at her cavalier and smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is idyllic!" she said;&mdash;"A sort of Arcadia without Corydon or
      Phyllis! Do all the inhabitants go to sleep or disappear in the daytime, I
      wonder?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not all, I imagine," replied Sir Walter; "For here comes one, though,
      judging from the slowness of his walk, he is in no haste to welcome his
      King!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The personage he spoke of was indeed approaching, and all the members of
      the Royal party watched his advance with considerable curiosity. He was
      tall and upright in bearing, but as he came nearer he was seen to be a man
      of great age, with a countenance on which sorrow and suffering had left
      their indelible traces. There were furrows on that face which tears had
      hollowed out for their swifter flowing, and the high intellectual brow
      bore lines and wrinkles of anxiety and pain, which were the soul's
      pen-marks of a tragic history. He was attired in simple fisherman's garb
      of rough blue homespun, and when he was within a few paces of the King, he
      raised his cap from his curly silver hair with an old-world grace and
      deferential courtesy. Sir Roger de Launay went forward to meet him and to
      explain the situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "His Majesty the King," he said, "has wished to make a surprise visit to
      his people of The Islands,&mdash;and he is here in person with the Queen.
      Can you oblige him with an escort to the principal places of interest?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The old man looked at him with a touch of amusement and derision.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There are no places here of interest to a King," he said; "Unless a poor
      man's house may serve for his curious comment! I am not his Majesty's
      subject&mdash;but I live under his protection and his laws,&mdash;and I am
      willing to offer him a welcome, since there is no one else to do so!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He spoke with a refined and cultured accent, and in his look and bearing
      evinced the breeding of a gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And your name?" asked Sir Roger courteously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My name is Réné Ronsard," he replied. "I was shipwrecked on this coast
      years ago. Finding myself cast here by the will of God, here I have
      remained!"
    </p>
    <p>
      As he said this, Sir Roger remembered what he had casually heard at times
      about the 'life-philosopher' who had built for himself a dwelling on The
      Islands out of the timbers of wrecked vessels. This must surely be the
      man! Delighted at having thus come upon the very person most likely to
      provide some sort of diversion for their Majesties, and requesting Ronsard
      to wait at a distance for a moment, he hastened back to the King and
      explained the position. Whereupon the monarch at once advanced with
      alacrity, and as he approached the venerable personage who had offered him
      the only hospitality he was likely to receive in this part of his realm,
      he extended his hand with a frank and kindly cordiality. Réné Ronsard
      accepted it with a slight but not over-obsequious salutation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We owe you our thanks," said the King, "for receiving us thus readily,
      and without notice; which is surely the truest form of hospitable
      kindness! That we are strangers here is entirely our own fault, due to our
      own neglect of our Island subjects; and it is for this that we have sought
      to know something of the place privately, before visiting it with such
      public ceremonial and state as it deserves. We shall be indebted to you
      greatly if you will lend us your aid in this intention."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your Majesty is welcome to my service in whatever way it can be of use to
      you," replied Ronsard slowly; "As you see, I am an old man and poor&mdash;I
      have lived here for well-nigh thirty years, making as little demand as
      possible upon the resources of either rough Nature or smooth civilization
      to provide me with sustenance. There is poor attraction for a king in such
      a simple home as mine!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "More than all men living, a king has cause to love simplicity," returned
      the monarch, as with his swift and keen glance he noted the old man's
      proud figure, fine worn features, and clear, though deeply-sunken eyes;&mdash;"for
      the glittering shows of ceremony are chiefly irksome to those who have to
      suffer their daily monotony. Let me present you to the Queen&mdash;she
      will thank you as I do, for your kindly consent to play the part of host
      to us to-day."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nay,"&mdash;murmured Ronsard&mdash;"No thanks&mdash;no thanks!" Then, as
      the King said a few words to his fair Consort, and she received the old
      man's respectful salutation in the cold, grave way which was her custom,
      he raised his eyes to her face, and started back with an involuntary
      exclamation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "By Heaven!" he said suddenly and bluntly, "I never thought to see any
      woman's beauty that could compare with that of my Gloria!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He spoke more to himself than to any listener, but the King hearing his
      words, was immediately on the alert, and when the whole Royal party moved
      on again, he, walking in a gracious and kindly way by the old man's side,
      and skilfully keeping up the conversation at first on mere generalities,
      said presently:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "And that name of Gloria;&mdash;may I ask you who it is that bears so
      strange an appellation?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Ronsard looked at him somewhat doubtingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your Majesty considers it strange? Had you ever seen her, you would think
      it the only fitting name for her," he answered,&mdash;"For she is surely
      the most glorious thing God ever made!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your wife&mdash;or daughter?" gently hinted the King.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old man smiled bitterly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sir, I have never owned wife or child! For aught I know Gloria may have
      been born like the goddess Aphrodite, of the sunlight and the sea! No
      other parents have ever claimed her."
    </p>
    <p>
      He checked himself, and appeared disposed to change the subject. The King
      looked at him encouragingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "May I not hear more of her?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ronsard hesitated&mdash;then with a certain abruptness replied&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nay&mdash;I am sorry I spoke of her! There is nothing to tell. I have
      said she is beautiful&mdash;and beauty is always stimulating&mdash;even to
      Kings! But your Majesty will have no chance of seeing her, as she is
      absent from home to-day."
    </p>
    <p>
      The King smiled;&mdash;had the rumours of his many gallantries reached The
      Islands then?&mdash;and was this 'life-philosopher' afraid that 'Gloria '&mdash;whoever
      she was&mdash;might succumb to his royal fascinations? The thought was
      subtly flattering, but he disguised the touch of amusement he felt, and
      spoke his next words with a kindly and indulgent air.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then, as I shall not see her, you may surely tell me of her? I am no
      betrayer of confidence!"
    </p>
    <p>
      A pale red tinged Ronsard's worn features&mdash;anon he said:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is no question of confidence, Sir,&mdash;and there is no secret or
      mystery associated with the matter. Gloria was, like myself, cast up from
      the sea. I found her half-drowned, a helpless infant tied to a floating
      spar. It was on the other side of these Islands&mdash;among the rocks
      where there is no landing-place. There is a little church on the heights
      up there, and every evening the men and boys practise their sacred
      singing. It was sunset, and I was wandering by myself upon the shore, and
      in the church above me I heard them chant 'Gloria! Gloria! Gloria in
      excelsis Deo!' And while they were yet practising this line I came upon
      the child,&mdash;lying like a strange lily, in a salt pool,&mdash;between
      two shafts of rock like fangs on either side of her, bound fast with rope
      to a bit of ship's timber. I untied her little limbs, and restored her to
      life; and all the time I was busy bringing her back to breath and motion,
      the singing in the church above me was 'Gloria!' and ever again 'Gloria!'
      So I gave her that name. That was nineteen years ago. She is married now."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Married!" exclaimed the King, with a curious sense of mingled relief and
      disappointment. "Then she has left you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, no, she has not left me!" replied Ronsard; "She stays with me till
      her husband is ready to give her a home. He is very poor, and lives in
      hope of better days. Meanwhile poverty so far smiles upon them that they
      are happy;&mdash;and happiness, youth and beauty rarely go together. For
      once they have all met in the joyous life of my Gloria!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I should like to see her!" said the King, musingly; "You have interested
      me greatly in her history!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The old man did not reply, but quickening his pace, moved on a little in
      advance of the King and his suite, to open a gate in front of them, which
      guarded the approach to a long low house with carved gables and lattice
      windows, over which a wealth of roses and jasmine clambered in long
      tresses of pink and white bloom. Smooth grass surrounded the place, and
      tall pine trees towered in the background; and round the pillars of the
      broad verandah, which extended to the full length of the house front,
      clematis and honeysuckle twined in thick clusters, filling the air with
      delicate perfume. The Royal party murmured their admiration of this
      picturesque abode, while Ronsard, with a nimbleness remarkable for a man
      of his age, set chairs on the verandah and lawn for his distinguished
      guests. Sir Walter Langton and the Marquis Montala strolled about the
      garden with some of the ladies, commenting on the simple yet exquisite
      taste displayed in its planting and arrangement; while the King and Queen
      listened with considerable interest to the conversation of their venerable
      host. He was a man of evident culture, and his description of the
      coral-fishing community, their habits and traditions, was both graphic and
      picturesque.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are they all away to-day?" asked the King.
    </p>
    <p>
      "All the men on this side of The Islands&mdash;yes, Sir," replied Ronsard;
      "And the women have enough to do inside their houses till their husbands
      return. With the evening and the moonlight, they will all be out in their
      fields and gardens, making merry with innocent dance and song, for they
      are very happy folk&mdash;much happier than their neighbours on the
      mainland."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you acquainted with the people of the mainland, then?" enquired the
      King.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sufficiently to know that they are dissatisfied;" returned Ronsard
      quietly,&mdash;"And that, deep down among the tangled grass and flowers of
      that brilliant pleasure-ground called Society, there is a fierce and
      starving lion called the People, waiting for prey!"
    </p>
    <p>
      His voice sank to a low and impressive tone, and for a moment his hearers
      looked astonished and disconcerted. He went on as though he had not seen
      the expression of their faces.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Here in The Islands there was the same discontent when I first came.
      Every man was in heart a Socialist,&mdash;every young boy was a budding
      Anarchist. Wild ideas fired their brains. They sought Equality. No man
      should be richer than another, they said. Equal lots,&mdash;equal lives.
      They had their own secret Society, connected with another similar one
      across the sea yonder. They were brave, clever and desperate,&mdash;moved
      by a burning sense of wrong,&mdash;wrong which they had not the skill to
      explain, but which they felt. It was difficult to persuade or soothe such
      men, for they were men of Nature,&mdash;not of Shams. But fierce and
      obstinate as they were, they were good to me when I was cast up for dead
      on their seashore. And I, in turn, have tried to be good to them. That is,
      I have tried to make them happy. For happiness is what we all work for and
      seek for,&mdash;from the beginning to the end of life. We go far afield
      for it, when it oftener lies at our very doors. Well!&mdash;they are a
      peaceful community now, and have no evil intentions towards anyone. They
      grudge no one his wealth&mdash;I think if the truth were known, they
      rather pity the rich man than envy him. So, at any rate, I have taught
      them to do. But, formerly, they were, to say the least of it, dangerous!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The King heard in silence, although the slightest quizzical lifting of his
      eyebrows appeared to imply that 'dangerous' was perhaps too strong a term
      by which to designate a handful of Socialistic coral-fishers.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is curious," went on Ronsard slowly, "how soon the sense of wrong and
      injustice infects a whole community. One malcontent makes a host of
      malcontents. This is a fact which many governments lose sight of. If I
      were the ruler of a country&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      Here he suddenly paused&mdash;then added with a touch of brusqueness&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pardon me, Sir; I have never known the formalities which apply to
      conversation with a king, and I am too old to learn now. No doubt I speak
      too boldly! To me you are no more than man; you should be more by
      etiquette&mdash;but by simple humanity you are not!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The King smiled, well pleased. This independent commoner, with his rough
      garb and rougher simplicity of speech, was a refreshing contrast to the
      obsequious personages by whom he was generally surrounded; and he felt an
      irresistible desire to know more of the life and surroundings of one who
      had gained a position of evident authority among the people of his own
      class.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Go on, my friend!" he said. "Honest expression of thought can offend none
      but knaves and fools; and though there are some who say I have a smack of
      both, yet I flatter myself I am wholly neither of the twain! Continue what
      you were saying&mdash;if you were ruler of a country, what would you do?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Réné Ronsard considered for a moment, and his furrowed brows set in a
      puzzled line.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think," he said slowly, at last, "I should choose my friends and
      confidants among the leaders of the people."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And is not that precisely what we all do?" queried the King lightly;
      "Surely every monarch must count his friends among the members of the
      Government?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But the Government does not represent the actual people, Sir!" said
      Ronsard quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No? Then what does it represent?" enquired the King, becoming amused and
      interested in the discussion, and holding up his hand to warn back De
      Launay, and the other members of his suite who were just coming towards
      him from their tour of inspection through the garden&mdash;"Every member
      of the Government is elected by the people, and returned by the popular
      vote. What else would you have?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ministers have not always the popular vote," said Ronsard; "They are
      selected by the Premier. And if the Premier should happen to be shifty,
      treacherous or self-interested, he chooses such men as are most likely to
      serve his own ends. And it can hardly be said, Sir, that the People truly
      return the members of Government. For when the time comes for one such man
      to be elected, each candidate secures his own agent to bribe the people,
      and to work upon them as though they were so much soft dough, to be
      kneaded into a political loaf for his private and particular eating. Poor
      People! Poor hard-working millions! In the main they are all too busy
      earning the wherewithal to Live, to have any time left to Think&mdash;they
      are the easy prey of the party agent, except&mdash;except when they gather
      to the voice of a real leader, one who though not in Government, governs!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And is there such an one?" enquired the King, while as he spoke his
      glance fell suddenly, and with an unpleasant memory, on the flashing blue
      of the sapphire in the Premier's signet he wore; "Here, or anywhere?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Over there!" said Ronsard impressively, pointing across the landscape
      seawards; "On the mainland there is not only one, but many! Women,&mdash;as
      well as men. Writers,&mdash;as well as speakers. These are they whom
      Courts neglect or ignore,&mdash;these are the consuming fire of thrones!"
      His old eyes flashed, and as he turned them on the statuesque beauty of
      the Queen, she started, for they seemed to pierce into the very recesses
      of her soul. "When Court and Fashion played their pranks once upon a time
      in France, there was a pen at work on the '<i>Contrat Social</i>'&mdash;the
      pen of one Rousseau! Who among the idle pleasure-loving aristocrats ever
      thought that a mere Book would have helped to send them to the scaffold!"
      He clenched his hand almost unconsciously&mdash;then he spoke more
      quietly. "That is what I mean, when I say that if I were ruler of a
      country, I should take special care to make friends with the people's
      chosen thinkers. Someone in authority"&mdash;and here he smiled
      quizzically&mdash;"should have given Rousseau an estate, and made him a
      marquis&mdash;<i>in time</i>! The leaders of an advancing Thought,&mdash;and
      not the leaders of a fixed Government are the real representatives of the
      People!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Something in this last sentence appeared to strike the King very forcibly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are a philosopher, Réné Ronsard," he said rising from his chair, and
      laying a hand kindly on his shoulder. "And so, in another way am I! If I
      understand you rightly, you would maintain that in many cases discontent
      and disorder are the fermentation in the mind of one man, who for some
      hidden personal motive works his thought through a whole kingdom; and you
      suggest that if that man once obtained what he wanted there would be an
      end of trouble&mdash;at any rate for a time till the next malcontent
      turned up! Is not that so?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is so, Sir," replied Ronsard; "and I think it has always been so. In
      every era of strife and revolution, we shall find one dissatisfied Soul&mdash;often
      a soul of genius and ambition&mdash;at the centre of the trouble."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Probably you are right," said the monarch indulgently; "But evidently the
      dissatisfied soul is not in <i>your</i> body! You are no Don Quixote
      fighting a windmill of imaginary wrongs, are you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      A dark red flush mounted to the old man's brow, and as it passed away,
      left him pale as death.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sir, I have fought against wrongs in my time; but they were not
      imaginary. I might have still continued the combat but for Gloria!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah! She is your peace-offering to an unjust world?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No Sir; she is God's gift to a broken heart," replied Ronsard gently.
      "The sea cast her up like a pearl into my life; and so for her sake I
      resolved to live. For her only I made this little home&mdash;for her I
      managed to gain some control over the rough inhabitants of these Islands,
      and encouraged in them the spirit of peace, mirth and gladness. I soothed
      their discontent, and tried to instil into them something of the Greek
      love of beauty and pleasure. But after all, my work sprang from a
      personal, I may as well say a selfish motive&mdash;merely to make the
      child I loved, happy!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then do you not regret that she is married, and no longer yours to
      cherish entirely?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, I regret nothing!" answered Ronsard; "For I am old and must soon die.
      I shall leave her in good and safe hands."
    </p>
    <p>
      The King looked at him thoughtfully, and seemed about to ask another
      question, then suddenly changing his mind, he turned to his Consort and
      said a few words to her in a low tone, whereupon as if in obedience to a
      command, she rose, and with all the gracious charm which she could always
      exert if she so pleased, she enquired of Ronsard if he would permit them
      to see something of the interior of his house.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Madam," replied Ronsard, with some embarrassment; "All I have is at your
      service, but it is only a poor place."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No place is poor that has peace in it," returned the Queen, with one of
      those rare smiles of hers, which so swiftly subjugated the hearts of men.
      "Will you lead the way?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus persuaded, Réné Ronsard could only bow a respectful assent, and obey
      the request, which from Royalty was tantamount to a command. Signing to
      the other members of the party, who had stood till now at a little
      distance, the Queen bade them all accompany her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The King will stay here till we return," she said, "And Sir Roger will
      stay with him!"
    </p>
    <p>
      With these words, and a flashing glance at De Launay, she stepped across
      the lawn, followed by her ladies-in-waiting, with Sir Walter Langton and
      the other gentlemen; and in another moment the brilliant little group had
      disappeared behind the trailing roses and clematis, which hung in
      profusion from the oaken projections of the wide verandah round Ronsard's
      picturesque dwelling. Standing still for a moment, with Sir Roger a pace
      behind him, the King watched them enter the house&mdash;then quickly
      turning round on his heel, faced his equerry with a broad smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now, De Launay," he said, "let us find Von Glauben!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Roger started with surprise, and not a little apprehension.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Von Glauben, Sir?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes&mdash;Von Glauben! He is here! I saw his face two minutes ago,
      peering through those trees!" And he pointed down a shadowy path, dark
      with the intertwisted gloom of untrained pine-boughs. "I am not dreaming,
      nor am I accustomed to imagine spectres! I am on the track of a mystery,
      Roger! There is a beautiful girl here named Gloria. The beautiful girl is
      married&mdash;possibly to a jealous husband, for she is apparently hidden
      away from all likely admirers, including myself! Now suppose Von Glauben
      is that husband!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He broke off and laughed. Sir Roger de Launay laughed with him; the idea
      was too irresistibly droll. But the King was bent on mischief, and
      determined to lose no time in compassing it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come along!" he said. "If this tangled path holds a secret, it shall be
      discovered before we are many minutes older! I am confident I saw Von
      Glauben; and what he can be doing here passes my comprehension! Follow me,
      Roger! If our worthy Professor has a wife, and his wife is beautiful, we
      will pardon him for keeping her existence a secret from us so long!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He laughed again; and turning into the path he had previously indicated,
      began walking down it rapidly, Sir Roger following closely, and revolving
      in his own perplexed mind the scene of the morning, when Von Glauben had
      expressed such a strong desire to get away to The Islands, and had
      admitted that there was "a lady in the case."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Really, it is most extraordinary!" he thought. "The King no sooner
      decides to break through conventional forms, than all things seem loosened
      from their moorings! A week ago, we were all apparently fixed in our
      orbits of exact routine and work&mdash;the King most fixed of all&mdash;but
      now, who can say what may happen next!"
    </p>
    <p>
      At that moment the monarch turned round.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This path seems interminable, Roger," he said; "It gets darker, closer
      and narrower. It thickens, in fact, like, the mystery we are probing!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Roger glanced about him. A straight band of trees hemmed them in on
      either side, and the daylight filtered through their stems pallidly,
      while, as the King had said, there seemed to be no end to the path they
      were following. They walked on swiftly, however, exchanging no further
      word, when suddenly an unexpected sound came sweeping up through the heavy
      branches. It was the rush and roar of the sea,&mdash;a surging, natural
      psalmody that filled the air, and quivered through the trees with the
      measured beat of an almost human chorus.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This must be another way to the shore," said the King, coming to a
      standstill; "And there must be rocks or caverns near. Hark how the waves
      thunder and reverberate through some deep hollow!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Roger listened, and heard the boom of water rolling in and rolling out
      again, with the regularity and rhythm of an organ swell, but he caught an
      echo of something else besides, which piqued his curiosity and provoked
      him to a touch of unusual excitement,&mdash;it was the sweet and
      apparently quickly suppressed sound of a woman's laughter. He glanced at
      his Royal master, and saw at once that he, too, had sharp ears for that
      silvery cadence of mirth, for his eyes flashed into a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      "On, Roger," he said softly; "We are close on the heels of the problem!"
    </p>
    <p>
      But they had only pressed forward a few steps when they were again brought
      to a sudden pause. A voice, whose gruffly mellow accents were familiar to
      both of them, was speaking within evidently close range, and the King,
      with a warning look, motioned De Launay back a pace or two, himself
      withdrawing a little into the shadow of the trees.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ach! Do not sing, my princess!" said the voice; "For if you open your
      rosy mouth of music, all the birds of the air, and all the little fishes
      of the sea will come to listen! And, who knows! Someone more dangerous
      than either a bird or a fish may listen also!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The King grasped De Launay by the arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Was I not right?" he whispered. "There is no mistaking Von Glauben's
      accent!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Roger looked, as he felt, utterly bewildered. In his own mind he felt
      it very difficult to associate the Professor with a love affair. Yet
      things certainly seemed pointing to some entanglement of the sort.
      Suddenly the King held up an admonitory finger.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Listen!" he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another voice spoke, rich and clear, and sweet as honey.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why should I not sing?" and there was a thrill of merriment in the
      delicious accents. "You are so afraid of everything to-day! Why? Why
      should I stay here with nothing to do? Because you tell me the King is
      visiting The Islands. What does that matter? What do I care for the King?
      He is nothing to me!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You would be something, perhaps, to him if he saw you," replied the
      guttural voice of Von Glauben. "It is safer to be out of his way. You are
      a very wilful princess this afternoon! You must remember your husband is
      jealous!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The King started.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Her husband! What the devil does Von Glauben know about her husband!"
    </p>
    <p>
      De Launay was dumb. A nameless fear and dismay began to possess him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My husband!" And the sweet voice laughed out again. "It would be strange
      indeed for a poor sailor to be jealous of a king!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "If the poor sailor had a beautiful wife he worshipped, and the King
      should admire the wife, he might have cause to be jealous!" replied Von
      Glauben; "And with some ladies, a poor sailor would stand no chance
      against a king! Why are you so rebellious, my princess, to-day? Have I not
      brought a letter from your beloved which plainly asks you to keep out of
      the sight of the King? Have I not been an hour with you here, reading the
      most beautiful poetry of Heine?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is why I want to sing," said the sweet voice, with a touch of
      wilfulness in its tone. "Listen! I will give you a reading of Heine in
      music!" And suddenly, rich and clear as a bell, a golden cadence of notes
      rang out with the words:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  "Ah, Hast thou forgotten, That I possessed thy heart?"
</pre>
    <p>
      The King sprang lightly out of his hiding-place, and with De Launay moved
      on slowly and cautiously through the trees.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ach, mein Gott!" they heard Von Glauben exclaim&mdash;"That is a
      bird-call which will float on wings to the ears of the King!"
    </p>
    <p>
      A soft laugh rippled on the air.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dear friend and master, why are you so afraid?" asked the caressing
      woman's voice again;&mdash;"We are quite hidden away from the Royal
      visitors,&mdash;and though you have been peeping at the King through the
      trees, and though you know he is actually in our garden, he will never
      find his way here! This is quite a secret little study and schoolroom,
      where you have taught me so much!&mdash;yes&mdash;so much!&mdash;and I am
      very grateful! And whenever you come to see me you teach me something more&mdash;you
      are always good and kind!&mdash;and I would not anger you for the world!
      But what is the good of knowing and feeling beautiful things, if I may not
      express them?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You do express them,&mdash;in yourself,&mdash;in your own existence and
      appearance!" said the Professor gruffly; "but that is a physiological
      accident which I do not expect you to understand!"
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a moment's silence. Then came a slight movement, as of quick
      feet clambering among loose pebbles, and the voice rang out again.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There! Now I am in my rocky throne! Do you remember&mdash;Ah, no!&mdash;you
      know nothing about it,&mdash;but I will tell you the story! It was here,
      in this very place, that my husband first saw me!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ach so!" murmured Von Glauben. "It is an excellent place to make a first
      appearance! Eve herself could not have chosen more picturesque
      surroundings to make a conquest of Adam!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Apparently his mild sarcasm fell on unheeding ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He was walking slowly all alone on the shore," went on the voice,
      dropping into a more plaintive and tender tone; "The sun had sunk, and one
      little star was sparkling in the sky. He looked up at the star&mdash;and&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then he saw a woman's eye," interpolated Von Glauben; "Which is always
      more attractive to weak man than an impossible-to-visit planet! What does
      Shakespeare say of women's eyes?
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  'Two of the fairest stars in all the heaven,
  Having some business, do entreat her eyes
  To twinkle in their spheres till they return.
  What if her eyes were there, they in her head?
  The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars,
  As daylight doth a lamp; her eye in heaven
  Would through the airy regions stream so bright,
  That birds would sing and think it were not night!'"
</pre>
    <p>
      "Ach! That is so!"
    </p>
    <p>
      As the final words left his lips, a rich note of melody stirred the air,
      and a song in which words and music seemed thoroughly welded together,
      rose vibratingly up to the quiet sky:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
        "Here by the sea,
        My Love found me!
  Seagulls over the waves were swinging;
  Mermaids down in their caves were singing,
  And one little star in the rosy sky
  Sparkled above like an angel's eye!
        My Love found me,
        And I and he
    Plighted our troth eternally!
        Oh day of splendour,
        And self-surrender!
    The day when my Love found me!

        Here, by the sea,
        My King crown'd me!
  Wild ocean sang for my Coronation,
  With the jubilant voice of a mighty nation!&mdash;
  'Mid the towering rocks he set my throne,
  And made me forever and ever his own!
        My King crown'd me,
        And I and he
    Are one till the world shall cease to be!
        Oh sweet love story!
        Oh night of glory!
    The night when my King crown'd me!"
</pre>
    <p>
      No language could ever describe the marvellous sweetness of the voice that
      sung these lines; it was so full of exquisite triumph, tenderness and
      passion, that it seemed more supernatural than human. When the song
      ceased, a great wave dashed on the shore, like a closing organ chord, and
      Von Glauben spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There! You wanted your own way, my princess, and you have had it! You
      have sung like one of the seraphim;&mdash;do not be surprised if mortals
      are drawn to listen. Sst! What is that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a pause. The King had inadvertently cracked a twig on one of the
      pine-boughs he was holding back in an endeavour to see the speakers. But
      he now boldly pushed on, beckoning De Launay to follow close, and in
      another minute had emerged on a small sandy plateau, which led, by means
      of an ascending path, to a rocky eminence, encircled by huge boulders and
      rocky pinnacles, which somewhat resembled peaks of white coral,&mdash;and
      here, on a height above him,&mdash;with the afternoon sun-glow bathing her
      in its full mellow radiance, sat a visibly enthroned goddess of the
      landscape,&mdash;a girl, or rather a perfect woman, more beautiful than
      any he had ever seen, or even imagined. He stared up at her in dazzled
      wonder, half blinded by the brightness of the sun and her almost equally
      blinding loveliness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Gloria!" he exclaimed breathlessly, hardly conscious of his own
      utterance; "You are Gloria!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The fair vision rose, and came swiftly forward with an astonished look in
      her bright deep eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes!" she said, "I am Gloria!"

      CHAPTER XII. &mdash; A SEA PRINCESS
    </h2>
    <p>
      Scarcely had she thus declared herself, when the Bismarckian head and
      shoulders of Von Glauben appeared above the protecting boulders; and
      moving with deliberate caution, the rest of his body came slowly after,
      till he stood fully declared in an attitude of military 'attention.' He
      showed neither alarm nor confusion at seeing the King; on the contrary,
      the fixed, wooden expression of his countenance betokened some
      deeply-seated mental obstinacy, and he faced his Royal master with the
      utmost composure, lifting the slouched hat he wore with his usual stiff
      and soldierly dignity, though carefully avoiding the amazed stare of his
      friend, Sir Roger de Launay.
    </p>
    <p>
      The King glanced him up and down with a smiling air of amused curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So this is how you pursue your scientific studies, Professor!" he said
      lightly; "Well!"&mdash;and he turned his eyes, full of admiration, on the
      beautiful creature who stood silently confronting him with all that
      perfect ease which expresses a well-balanced mind,&mdash;"Wisdom is often
      symbolised to us as a marble goddess,&mdash;but when Pallas Athene takes
      so fair a shape of flesh and blood as this, who shall blame even a veteran
      philosopher for sitting at her feet in worship!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pardon me, Sir," returned Von Glauben calmly; "There is no goddess of
      Wisdom here, so please you, but only a very simple and unworldly young
      woman. She is&mdash;" Here he hesitated a moment, then went on&mdash;"She
      is merely the adopted child of a fisherman living on these Islands."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am aware of that!" said the King still smiling. "Réné Ronsard is his
      name. He is my host to-day; and he has told me something of her. But,
      certes, he did not mention that you had adopted her also!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Von Glauben flushed vexedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sir," he stammered, "I could explain&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Another time!" interrupted the King, with a touch of asperity.
      "Meanwhile, present your&mdash;your pupil in the poesy of Heine,&mdash;to
      me!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus commanded, the Professor, casting a vexed glance at De Launay, who
      did not in the least comprehend his distress, went to the girl, who during
      their brief conversation had stood quietly looking from one to the other
      with an expression of half-amused disdain on her lovely features.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Gloria," he began reluctantly&mdash;then whispering in her ear, he
      muttered&mdash;"I told you your voice would do mischief, and it has done
      it!" Then aloud&mdash;"Gloria,&mdash;this&mdash;this is the King!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She smiled, but did not change her erect and easy attitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The King is welcome!" she said simply.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had evidently no intention of saluting the monarch; and Sir Roger de
      Launay gazed at her in mingled surprise and admiration. She was certainly
      wonderfully beautiful. Her complexion had the soft clear transparency of a
      pink sea-shell&mdash;her eyes, large and lustrous, were as densely blue as
      the dark azure in the depths of a wave,&mdash;and her hair, of a warm
      bronze chestnut, caught back with a single band of red coral, seemed to
      have gathered in its rich curling clusters all the deepest tints of autumn
      leaves flecked with a golden touch of the sun. Her figure, clad in a
      straight garment of rough white homespun, was the model of perfect
      womanhood. She stood a little above the medium height, her fair head
      poised proudly on regal shoulders, while the curve of the full bosom would
      have baffled the sculptural genius of a Phidias. The whole exquisite
      outline of her person was the expressed essence of beauty, from the
      lightest wave of her hair, down to her slender ankles and small feet; and
      the look that irradiated her noble features was that of child-like
      happiness and repose,&mdash;the untired expression of one who had never
      known any other life than the innocent enjoyment bestowed upon her by God
      and divine Nature. Beautiful as his Queen-Consort was and always had been,
      the King was forced to admit to himself that here was a woman far more
      beautiful,&mdash;and as he looked upon her critically, he saw that there
      was a light and splendour about her which only the happiness of Love can
      give. Her whole aspect was as of one uplifted into a finer atmosphere than
      that of earth,&mdash;she seemed to exhale purity from herself, as a rose
      exhales perfume, and her undisturbed serenity and dignity, when made aware
      of the Royal presence, were evidently not the outcome of ill-breeding or
      discourtesy, but of mere self-respect and independence. He approached her
      with a strange hesitation, which for him was quite a new experience.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am glad I have been fortunate enough to meet you!" he said gently;&mdash;"Some
      kindly fate guided my steps down the path which brought me to this part of
      the shore, else I might have gone away without seeing you!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That would have been no loss to your Majesty," answered Gloria calmly;&mdash;"For
      to see me, is of no use to anyone!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Would your husband say so?" hazarded the King with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes flashed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My husband would say what is right," she replied. "He would know better
      how to talk to you than I do!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He had insensibly drawn nearer to her as he spoke; meanwhile Von Glauben,
      with a disconsolate air, had joined Sir Roger de Launay, who, by an
      enquiring look and anxious uplifting of his eyebrows, dumbly asked what
      was to be the upshot of this affair,&mdash;only to receive a dismal shake
      of the head in reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Possibly I know your husband," went on the King, anxious to continue
      conversation with so beautiful a creature. "If I do, and he is in my
      personal service, he shall not lack promotion! Will you tell me his name?"
    </p>
    <p>
      A startled look came into the girl's eyes, and a deep blush swept over her
      fair cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I dare not!" she said;&mdash;"He has forbidden me!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Forbidden you!" The King recoiled a step&mdash;a vague suspicion rankled
      in his mind. "Then, though your King asks you a friendly question, you
      refuse to answer it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Von Glauben here gripped Sir Roger so fiercely by the arm, that the latter
      nearly cried out with pain.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She must not tell," he muttered&mdash;"She must not&mdash;she will not!"
    </p>
    <p>
      But Gloria was looking straight at her Royal questioner.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have no King but my husband!" she said firmly. "I have sworn before God
      to obey him in all things, and I will not break my vow!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good girl! Wise girl!" exclaimed Von Glauben. "Ach, if all the beautiful
      women so guarded their tongues and obeyed their husbands, what a happy
      world it would be!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The King turned upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "True! But you are not bound by the confidences of marriage, Professor,&mdash;so
      that while in our service our will must be your law! You, therefore, can
      perhaps tell me the name of the fortunate man who has wedded this fair
      lady?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The Professor's countenance visibly reddened.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sir," he stammered&mdash;"With every respect for your Majesty, I would
      rather lose my much-to-be-appreciated post with you than betray my
      friends!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The King suddenly lost patience.
    </p>
    <p>
      "By Heaven!" he exclaimed, "Is my command to be slighted and set aside as
      if it were naught? Not while I am king of this country! What mystery is
      here that I am not to know?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Gloria laughed outright, and the pretty ripple of mirth, so unforced and
      natural, diverted the monarch's irritation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, you are angry!" she said, her lovely eyes twinkling and sparkling
      like diamonds:&mdash;"So! Then your Majesty is no more than a very common
      man who loses temper when he cannot have his own way!" She laughed again,
      and the King stared at her unoffended,&mdash;being spellbound, both by her
      regal beauty, and her complete indifference to himself. "I will speak like
      the prophets do in the Bible and say, 'Lo! there is no mystery, O King!' I
      am only poor Gloria, a sailor's wife,&mdash;and the sailor has a place on
      board your son the Crown Prince's yacht, and he does not want his master
      to know that he is married lest he lose that place! Is not that plain and
      clear, O King? And why should I disobey my beloved in such a simple
      matter?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The King was still in something of a fume.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is no reason why you should disobey," he said more quietly, but
      still with vexation;&mdash;"But, equally, there is no reason why your
      husband should be dismissed from the Crown Prince's service, because he
      has chosen to marry. If you tell me his name, I will make all things easy
      for him, for you, and your future. Can you not trust me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      With wonderful grace and quickness Gloria suddenly sprang forward, caught
      the King's hand, kissed it, and then threw it lightly away from her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No!" she said, with a pretty defiance; "I kiss the hand of the country's
      King&mdash;but I have my own King to serve!"
    </p>
    <p>
      And pausing for no more words, she turned away, sprang lightly up the
      rocks as swiftly as a roe-deer, and disappeared. And from some hidden
      corner, clear and full and sweet, her voice rang out above the peaceful
      plashing of the waves:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
           "My King crown'd me!
            And I and he
  Are one till the world shall cease to be!"
</pre>
    <p>
      Stricken dumb and confused by the suddenness of her action, and the
      swiftness of her departure, the King stood for a moment inert, gazing up
      the rocky height with the air of one who has seen a vision of heaven
      withdrawn again into its native element. Some darkening doubt troubled his
      mind, and it was with an altogether changed and stern countenance that he
      confronted Von Glauben.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Last night, Professor, you were somewhat anxious for our health and
      safety," he said severely; "It is our turn now to be equally anxious for
      yours! We are of opinion that you, like ourselves, run some risk of danger
      by meddling in affairs which do not concern you! Silence!" This, as the
      Professor, deeply moved by his Royal master's evident displeasure, made an
      attempt to speak. "We will hear all you have to say to-morrow. Meanwhile&mdash;follow
      your fair charge!" And he pointed up in the direction whither Gloria had
      vanished. "Her husband"&mdash;and he emphasized the word,&mdash;"whoever
      he is, appears to have entrusted her safety to you;&mdash;see that you do
      not betray his trust, even though you have betrayed mine!"
    </p>
    <p>
      At this remark Von Glauben was visibly overcome.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sir, you have never had reason to complain of any lack of loyalty in me
      to you and to your service," he said with an earnest dignity which became
      him well;&mdash;"In the matter of the poor child yonder, whose beauty
      would surely be a fatal snare to any man, there is much to be told,&mdash;which
      if told truly, will prove that I am merely the slave of circumstances
      which were not created by me,&mdash;and which it is possible for a
      faithful servant of your Majesty to regret! But a betrayer of trust I have
      never been, and I beseech your Majesty to believe me when I say that the
      acuteness of that undeserved reproach cuts me to the heart! I yield to no
      man in the respect and affection I entertain for your Royal person, not
      even to De Launay here&mdash;who knows&mdash;who knows&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      He broke off, unable through strong emotion to proceed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Who knows'&mdash;What?" enquired the King, turning his steadfast eyes on
      Sir Roger.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing, Sir! Absolutely nothing!" replied the equerry, opening his eyes
      as widely as their habitual langour would permit; "I am absolutely
      ignorant of everything concerning Von Glauben except that he is an honest
      man! That I certainly do know!"
    </p>
    <p>
      A slight smile cleared away something of the doubt and displeasure on the
      King's face. Approaching the disconsolate Professor, he laid one hand on
      his shoulder and looked him steadily in the eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "By my faith, Von Glauben, if I thought positively that you could play me
      false in any matter, I would never believe a man again! Come! Forgive my
      hasty speech, and do not look so downcast! Honest I have always known you
      to be,&mdash;and that you will prove your honesty, I do not doubt! But&mdash;there
      is something in this affair which awakens grave suspicion in my mind. For
      to-day I press no questions&mdash;but to-morrow I must know all! You
      understand? <i>All</i>! Say this to the girl, Gloria,&mdash;say it to her
      husband also&mdash;as, of course, you know who her husband is. If he
      serves on Prince Humphry's yacht, that is enough to say that Humphry
      himself has probably seen her. Under all the circumstances, I confess, my
      dear Von Glauben, that your presence here is a riddle which needs
      explanation!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It shall be explained, Sir&mdash;" murmured the Professor.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Naturally! It must, of course be explained. But I hope you give me credit
      for not being altogether a fool; and I have an idea that my son's frequent
      mysterious visits to The Islands have something to do with this fair
      Gloria of Glorias!" Von Glauben started involuntarily. "You perhaps think
      it too? Or know it? Well, if it is so, I can hardly blame him overmuch,&mdash;though
      I am sorry he should have selected a poor sailor's wife as a subject for
      his secret amours! I should have thought him possessed of more honour.
      However&mdash;to-morrow I shall look to you for a full account of the
      matter. For the present, I excuse your attendance, and permit you to
      remain with her whom you call 'princess'!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He stepped back, and, taking De Launay's arm, turned round at once, and
      walked away back to Ronsard's house by the path he had followed with such
      eagerness and care.
    </p>
    <p>
      Von Glauben watched the two tall figures disappear, and then with a
      troubled look, began to climb slowly up the rocks in the direction where
      Gloria had gone. His reflections were not altogether as philosophical as
      usual, because as he said to himself&mdash;"One can never tell how a woman
      is going to meet misfortune! Sometimes she takes it well; and then the men
      who have ruthlessly destroyed her happiness go on their way rejoicing; but
      more often she takes it ill, and there is the devil to pay! Yet&mdash;Gloria
      is not like any ordinary woman&mdash;she is a carefully selected specimen
      of her sex, which a kindly Nature has produced as an example of what women
      were intended to be when they were first created. I wonder where she has
      hidden herself?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Arriving at the summit of the ascent, he peered down towards the sea.
      Slopes of rank grass and sea-daisies tufted the rocks on this side,
      divided by certain deep hollows which the action of the waves had
      honeycombed here and there; and below the grass was the shore, powdered
      thickly with sand, of a fine, light, and sparkling colour, like gold dust.
      Here in the full light of the sinking sun lay Gloria, her head pillowed
      against a rough stone, on the top of which a tall cluster of daisies,
      sometimes called moon-flowers, waved like white plumes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Gloria!" called Von Glauben.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked up, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Has Majesty gone?" she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Gone for the present," replied the Professor, beginning to put one foot
      cautiously before the other down a roughly hewn stairway in the otherwise
      almost inaccessible cliff. "But, like the sun which is setting to-night,
      he will rise again to-morrow!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Shall I come and help you down?" enquired the girl, turning on her elbow
      as she lay, and lifting her lovely face, radiant as a flower, towards him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Whether down or up, you shall never help me, my princess!" he replied.
      "When I can neither climb nor fall without the assistance of a woman's
      hand, I shall take a pistol and tell it to whisper in my ear&mdash;'Good-bye,
      Heinrich Von Glauben! You are all up&mdash;finish&mdash;gone!'"
    </p>
    <p>
      Here, with a somewhat elephantine jump, he alighted beside her and threw
      himself on the warm sand with a deep sigh of mingled exhaustion and
      relief.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You would be very wicked to put a pistol to your ear," said Gloria
      severely;&mdash;"It is only a coward who shoots himself!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ach so! And it is a brave man who shoots others! That is curious, is it
      not, princess? It is a little bit of man's morality; but we have no time
      to discuss it now. We have something more serious to consider,&mdash;your
      husband!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him wonderingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My husband? Do you really think he will be very angry that the King saw
      me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The Professor appeared to be considering the question; but in reality he
      was studying the exquisite delicacy of the face turned so wistfully upon
      him, and the lovely lines of the slim throat and rounded chin&mdash;"So
      beautiful a creature"&mdash;he was saying within himself&mdash;"And must
      she also suffer pain and disillusion like all the rest of her unfortunate
      sex!" Aloud he replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My princess, it is not for me to say he will be 'angry,'&mdash;for how
      could he be angry with the one he loves to such adoration! He will be
      sorry and troubled&mdash;it will put him into a great difficulty! Ach!&mdash;a
      whole nest of difficulties!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why?" And Gloria's eyes filled with sudden tears. "I would not grieve him
      for the world! I cannot understand why it should matter at all, even if
      the King does find out that he is married. Are the rules so strict for all
      the men who serve on board the Royal vessels?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Von Glauben bit his lips to hide an involuntary smile. But he answered her
      with quite a martinet air.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, they are strict&mdash;very strict! Particularly so in the case of
      your husband. You see, my child&mdash;you do not perhaps quite understand&mdash;but
      he is a sort of superior officer on board; and in close personal
      attendance on the Crown Prince."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He did not tell me that!" said the girl a little anxiously; "Yet surely
      it would not matter if he loses one place; can he not easily get another?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Von Glauben was looking at her with a grave, almost melancholy intentness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Listen, my princess,&mdash;listen to your poor old friend, who means you
      so much good, and no harm at all! Your husband&mdash;and I too, for that
      matter,&mdash;wished much to prevent the King from seeing you&mdash;for&mdash;for
      many reasons. When I heard he was coming to The Islands, I resolved to
      arrive here before him, and so I did. I said nothing to Ronsard, not even
      to warn him of the King's impending visit. I took you just quietly, as I
      have often done, for a walk, with a book to read and to explain to you,
      because you tell me you want to study; though in my opinion you know quite
      enough&mdash;for a woman. I gave you a letter from your husband, and you
      know he asked you in that letter to avoid all possibility of meeting with
      the King. Good! Well, now, what happens? You sing&mdash;and lo! his
      Majesty, like a fish on a hook, is drawn up open-mouthed to your feet!
      Now, who is to blame? You or I?"
    </p>
    <p>
      A little perplexed line appeared on the girl's fair brows. "I am, I
      suppose!" she said somewhat plaintively,&mdash;"But yet, even now, I do
      not understand. What is the King? He is nothing! He does nothing for
      anybody! People make petitions to him, and he never answers them&mdash;they
      try to point out errors and abuses, and he takes no trouble to remedy them&mdash;he
      is no better than a wooden idol! He is not a real man, though he looks
      like one."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, you think he looks like one?" murmured Von Glauben; "That is to say
      you are not altogether displeased with his appearance?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Gloria's eyes darkened a moment with thought,&mdash;then flashed with
      laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," she said frankly&mdash;"He is more kingly than I thought a king
      could be. But he should not lose temper. That spoils all dignity!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Von Glauben smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Kings are but mortal," he said, "and never to lose temper would be
      impossible to any man."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is such a waste of time!" declared Gloria&mdash;"Why should anyone
      lose self-control? It is like giving up a sword to an enemy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is one of Réné Ronsard's teachings,"&mdash;said the Professor&mdash;"It
      is excellent in theory! But in practice I have seen Réné give way to
      temper himself, with considerable enjoyment of his own mental
      thunderstorm. As for the King, he is generally a very equable personage;
      and he has one great virtue&mdash;that is courage. He is brave as a lion&mdash;perhaps
      braver than many lions!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She raised her eyes enquiringly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Has he proved it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Rather taken aback by the question, he stared at her solemnly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Proved it? Well! He has had no chance. The country has been at peace for
      many years&mdash;but if there should ever be a war&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Would he go and fight for the country?" enquired Gloria.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In person? No. He would not be allowed to do that. His life would be
      endangered&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course!" interrupted the girl with a touch of contempt; "But if he
      would allow himself to be ruled by others in such a matter, I do not call
      him brave!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The Professor drew out his spectacles, and fixing them on his nose with
      much care, regarded her through them with bland and kindly interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very simple and primitive reasoning, my princess!" he said; "And from an
      early historic point of view, your idea is correct. In the olden times
      kings went themselves to battle, and led their soldiers on to victory in
      person. It was very fine; much finer than our modern ways of warfare. But
      it has perhaps never occurred to you that a king's life nowadays is always
      in danger? He can do nothing more completely courageous than to show
      himself in public!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are kings then so hated?" she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "They are not loved, it must be confessed," returned Von Glauben, taking
      off his spectacles again; "But that is quite their own fault. They seldom
      do anything to deserve the respect,&mdash;much less the affection of their
      subjects. But this king&mdash;this man you have just seen&mdash;certainly
      deserves both."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, what has he done?" asked Gloria wonderingly. "I have heard people
      say he is very wicked&mdash;that he takes other men's wives away from them&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      The Professor coughed discreetly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My princess, let me suggest to you that he could scarcely take other
      men's wives away from them, unless those wives were perfectly willing to
      go!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She gave an impatient gesture.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, there are weak women, no doubt; but then a king should know better
      than to put temptation in their way. If a man undertakes to be strong, he
      should also be honourable. Then,&mdash;what of the taxes the King imposes
      on the people? The sufferings of the poor over there on the mainland are
      terrible!&mdash;I know all about them! I have heard Sergius Thord!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The Professor gave an uncomfortable start.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have heard Sergius Thord? Where?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Here!" And Gloria smiled at his expression of wonderment. "He has spoken
      often to our people, and he is father Réné's friend."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And what does he talk about when he speaks here?" enquired Von Glauben.
      "When does he come, and how does he go?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Always at night," answered Gloria; "He has a sailing skiff of his own,
      and on many an evening when the wind sets in our quarter, he arrives quite
      suddenly, all alone, and in a moment, as if by magic, the Islanders all
      seem to know he is here. On the shore, or in the fields he assembles them
      round him, and tells them many things that are plain and true. I have
      heard him speak often of the shortness of life and its many sorrows, and
      he says we could all make each other happy for the little time we have to
      live, if we would. And I think he is right; it is only wicked and selfish
      people who make others unhappy!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The Professor was silent. Gloria, watching him, wondered at his somewhat
      perturbed expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you know the King very well?" she asked suddenly. "He seemed very
      cross with you!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Von Glauben roused himself from a fit of momentary abstraction.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes,&mdash;he was cross!" he rejoined. "I, like your husband, am in his
      service&mdash;and I ought to have been on duty to-day. It will be all
      right, however&mdash;all right! But&mdash;" He paused for a moment, then
      went on&mdash;"You say that only wicked and selfish people make others
      unhappy. Now suppose your husband were wicked and selfish enough to make
      <i>you</i> unhappy; what would you say?"
    </p>
    <p>
      A sweet smile shone in her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He could not make me unhappy!" she said. "He would not try! He loves me,
      and he will always love me!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, suppose," persisted the Professor&mdash;"Just for the sake of
      argument&mdash;suppose he had deceived you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      With a low cry she sprang up.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Impossible!" she exclaimed; "He is truth itself! He could not deceive
      anyone!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come and sit down again," said Von Glauben tranquilly; "It is disturbing
      to my mind to see you standing there pronouncing your faith in the
      integrity of man! No male creature deserves such implicit trust, and
      whenever a woman gives it, she invariably finds out her mistake!"
    </p>
    <p>
      But Gloria stood still, The rich colour had faded from her cheeks&mdash;her
      eyes were dilated with alarm, and her breath came and went quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You must explain," she said hurriedly; "You must tell me what you mean by
      suggesting such a wicked thought to me as that my husband could deceive
      me! It is not right or kind of you,&mdash;it is cruel!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The Professor scrambled up hastily out of his sandy nook, and approaching
      her, took her hand very gently and respectfully in his own and kissed it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear&mdash;my princess&mdash;I was wrong! Forgive me!" he murmured,
      and there was a little tremor in his voice; "But can you not understand
      the possibility of a man loving a woman very much, and yet deceiving her
      for her good?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It could never be for her good," said Gloria firmly; "It would not be for
      mine! No lie ever lasts!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Von Glauben looked at her with a sense of reverence and something like
      awe. The after-glow of the sinking sun was burning low down upon the sea,
      and turning it to fiery crimson, and as she stood bathed in its splendour,
      the white rocks towering above her, and the golden sands sparkling at her
      feet, she appeared like some newly descended angel expressing the very
      truth of Heaven itself in her own presence on earth. As they stood thus,
      the sudden boom of a single cannon echoed clear across the waves.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There goes the King!" said Von Glauben; "Majesty departs for the present,
      having so far satisfied his curiosity! That gun is the signal. Child!"&mdash;and
      turning towards her again, he took both her hands in his, and spoke with
      emphatic gravity and kindness&mdash;"Remember that I am your friend
      always! Whatever chances to you, do not forget that you may command my
      service and devotion till death! In this strange life, we never know from
      day to day what may happen to us, for constant change is the law of Nature
      and the universe,&mdash;but after all, there is something in the soul of a
      true man which does not change with the elements,&mdash;and that is&mdash;loyalty
      to a sworn faith! In my heart, I have sworn an oath of fealty to you, my
      beautiful little princess of the sea!&mdash;and it is a vow that shall
      never be broken! Do you understand? And will you remember?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Her large dark blue eyes looked trustingly into his.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indeed, I will never forget!" she said, with a touch of wistfulness in
      her accents; "But I do not know why you should be anxious for me&mdash;there
      is nothing to fear for my happiness. I have all the love I care for in the
      world!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And long may you keep it!" said the Professor earnestly; "Come! It will
      soon be time for me to leave you, and I must see Réné before I go. If you
      follow my advice, you will say nothing to him of having met the King&mdash;not
      for the present, at any rate."
    </p>
    <p>
      She agreed to this, though with some little hesitation,&mdash;then they
      ascended the cliff, and walking by way of the pine-wood through which the
      King had come, arrived at Ronsard's house, to find the old man quite
      alone, and peacefully engaged in tying up the roses and jessamine on the
      pillars of his verandah. His worn face lighted up with animation and
      tenderness as Gloria approached him and threw her arms around his neck,
      and to her he related the incident of the King and Queen's unexpected
      visit, as a sort of accidental, uninteresting, and wholly unimportant
      occurrence. The Queen, he said, was very beautiful; but too cold in her
      manner, though she had certainly taken much interest in seeing the house
      and garden.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was just as well you were absent, child," he added&mdash;"Royalty
      brings an atmosphere with it which is not wholesome. A king never knows
      what it is to be an honest man!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Those are your old, discarded theories, Ronsard!" said Von Glauben,
      shaking his head;&mdash;"You said you would never return to them!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Aye!" rejoined Ronsard;&mdash;"I have tried to put away all my old
      thoughts and dreams for her sake"&mdash;and his gaze rested lovingly on
      Gloria as, standing on tiptoe to reach a down-drooping rose, she gathered
      it and fastened it in her bosom. "There should only be peace and
      contentment where <i>she</i> dwells! But sometimes my life's long
      rebellion against sham and injustice stirs in my blood, and I long to pull
      down the ignorant people's idols of wood and straw, and set up men in
      place of dummies!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A Mumbo-Jumbo of some kind has always been necessary in the world, my
      friend," said the Professor calmly; "Either in the shape of a deity or a
      king. A wood and straw Nonentity is better than an incarnated fleshly
      Selfishness. Will you give me supper before I leave?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Ronsard smiled a cheery assent, and Gloria preceding them, and singing in
      a low tone to herself as she went, they all entered the house together.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, the Royal yacht was scudding back to the mainland over crisp
      waters on the wings of a soft breeze, with a bright moon flying through
      fleecy clouds above, and silvering the foam-crests of the waves below.
      There was music on board,&mdash;the King and Queen dined with their
      guests,&mdash;and laughter and gay converse intermingled with the sound of
      song. They talked of their day's experience&mdash;of the beauty of The
      Islands&mdash;of Ronsard,&mdash;his quaint house and quainter self,&mdash;so
      different to the persons with whom they associated in their own exclusive
      and brilliant Court 'set,' and the pretty Countess Amabil flirting
      harmlessly with Sir Walter Langton, suggested that a 'Flower Feast' or
      Carnival should be held during the summer, for the surprise and benefit of
      the Islanders, who had never yet seen a Royal pageant of pleasure on their
      shores.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Sir Roger de Launay, ever watching the Queen, saw that she was very
      pale, and more silent even than was her usual habit, and that her eyes
      every now and again rested on the King, with something of wonder, as well
      as fear.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIII. &mdash; SECRET SERVICE
    </h2>
    <p>
      In one of the ultra-fashionable quarters of the brilliant and overcrowded
      metropolis which formed the nucleus and centre of everything notable or
      progressive in the King's dominions, there stood a large and
      aggressively-handsome house, over-decorated both outside and in, and
      implying in its general appearance vulgarity, no less than wealth. These
      two things go together very much nowadays; in fact one scarcely ever sees
      them apart. The fair, southern city of the sea was not behind other modern
      cities in luxury and self-aggrandisement, and there were certain members
      of the population who made it their business to show all they were worth
      in their domestic and home surroundings. One of the most flagrant
      money-exhibitors of this kind was a certain Jew named David Jost. Jost was
      the sole proprietor of the most influential newspaper in the kingdom, and
      the largest shareholder in three other newspaper companies, all apparently
      differing in party views, but all in reality working into the same hands,
      and for the same ends. Jost and his companies virtually governed the
      Press; and what was euphoniously termed 'public opinion' was the opinion
      of Jost. Should anything by chance happen to get into his own special
      journal, or into any of the other journals connected with Jost, which Jost
      did not approve of, or which might be damaging to Jost's social or
      financial interests, the editor in charge was severely censured; if the
      fault occurred again he was promptly dismissed. 'Public opinion' had to be
      formed on Jost's humour; otherwise it was no opinion at all. A few other
      newspapers led a precarious existence in offering a daily feeble
      opposition to Jost; but they had not cash enough to carry on the quarrel.
      Jost secured all the advertisers, and as a natural consequence of this,
      could well afford to be the 'voice of the people' ad libitum. He was
      immensely wealthy, openly vicious, and utterly unscrupulous; and made
      brilliant speculative 'deals' in the unsuspecting natures of those who
      were led, by that bland and cheery demeanour which is generally associated
      with a large paunch, to consider him a 'good fellow' with his 'heart in
      the right place.' With regard to this last assertion, it may be doubted
      whether he had a heart at all, in any place, right or wrong. He was
      certainly not given to sentiment. He had married for money, and his wife
      had died in a mad-house. He was now anxious to marry again for position;
      and while looking round the market for a sufficiently perfect person of
      high-breeding, he patronized the theatre largely, and 'protected' several
      ballet-girls and actresses. Everyone knew that his life was black with
      villainy and intrigue of the most shameless kind, yet everyone swore that
      he was a good man. Such is the value of a limitless money-bag!
    </p>
    <p>
      It was very late in the evening of the day following that on which the
      King had paid his unexpected visit to The Islands,&mdash;and David Jost
      had just returned from a comic opera-house, where he had supped in private
      with two or three painted heroines of the footlights. He was in an
      excellent humour with himself. He had sprung a mine on the public; and a
      carefully-concocted rumour of war with a foreign power had sent up certain
      stocks and shares in which he had considerable interest. He smiled, as he
      thought of the general uneasiness he was creating by a few headlines in
      his newspaper; and he enjoyed to the full the tranquil sense of having
      flung a bone of discord between two nations, in order to watch them from
      his arm-chair fighting like dogs for it tooth and claw, till one or the
      other gave in.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lutera will have to thank me for this," he said to himself; "And he will
      owe me both a place and a title!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat down at his desk in his warm and luxuriously-furnished study,&mdash;turned
      over a few letters, and then glanced up at the clock. Its hands pointed to
      within a few minutes of midnight. Taking up a copy of his own newspaper,
      he frowned slightly, as he saw that a certain leading article in favour of
      the Jesuit settlement in the country had not appeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Crowded out, I suppose, for want of space," he said; "I must see that it
      goes in to-morrow. These Jesuits know a thing or two; and they are not
      going to plank down a thousand pounds for nothing. They have paid for
      their advertisement, and they must have it. They ought to have had it
      to-day. Lutera must warn the King that it will not do to offend the
      Church. There's a lot of loose cash lying idle in the Vatican,&mdash;we
      may as well have some of it! His Majesty has acted most unwisely in
      refusing to grant the religious Orders the land they want. He must be
      persuaded to yield it to them by degrees,&mdash;in exchange of course for
      plenty of cash down, without loss of dignity!"
    </p>
    <p>
      At that moment the door-bell rang softly, as if it were pulled with
      extreme caution. A servant answered it, and at once came to his master's
      room.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A gentleman to see you, sir, on business," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jost looked up.
    </p>
    <p>
      "On business? At this time of night? Say I cannot see him&mdash;tell him
      to come again to-morrow!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The servant withdrew, only to return again with a more urgent statement.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The gentleman says he must see you, sir; he comes from the Premier."
    </p>
    <p>
      "From the Premier?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, sir; his business is urgent, he says, and private. He sent in his
      card, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      Here he handed over the card in question, a small, unobtrusive bit of
      pasteboard, laid in solitary grandeur on a very large silver salver.
    </p>
    <p>
      David Jost took it up, and scanned it with some curiosity. "'Pasquin
      Leroy'! H'm! Don't know the name at all. 'Urgent business; bear private
      credentials from the Marquis de Lutera'!" He paused again, considering,&mdash;then
      turned to the waiting attendant. "Show him in.".
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, sir!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Another moment and Pasquin Leroy entered,&mdash;but it was an altogether
      different Pasquin Leroy to the one that had recently enrolled himself as
      an associate of Sergius Thord's Revolutionary Committee. <i>That</i>
      particular Pasquin had seemed somewhat of a dreamer and a visionary, with
      a peculiar and striking resemblance to the King; <i>this</i> Pasquin Leroy
      had all the alertness and sharpness common to a practised journalist,
      press-reporter or commercial traveller. Moreover, his countenance, adorned
      with a black mustache, and small pointed beard, wore a cold and
      concentrated air of business&mdash;and he confronted the Jew millionaire
      without the slightest embarrassment or apology for having broken in upon
      his seclusion at so unseasonable an hour. He used a pince-nez, and was
      constantly putting it to his eyes, as though troubled with
      short-sightedness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I presume your matter cannot wait, sir," said Jost, surveying him coolly,
      without rising from his seat,&mdash;"but if it can&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It cannot!" returned Leroy, bluntly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jost stared.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So! You come from the Marquis de Lutera?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your credentials?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Leroy stepped close up to him, and with a sudden movement, which was
      somewhat startling, held up his right hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This signet is, I believe, familiar to you,&mdash;and it will be enough
      to prove that I come on confidential business which cannot be trusted to
      writing!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Jost gazed at the flashing sapphire on the stranger's hand with a sense of
      deadly apprehension. He recognised the Premier's ring well enough; and he
      also knew that it would never have been sent to him in this mysterious way
      unless the matter in question was almost too desperate for whispering
      within four walls. An uneasy sensation affected him; he pulled at his
      collar, looked round the room as though in search of inspiration, and then
      finally bringing his small, swine-like eyes to bear on the neat soldierly
      figure before him, he said with a careless air:
    </p>
    <p>
      "You probably bring news for the Press affecting the present policy?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That remains to be seen!" replied Leroy imperturbably; "From a perfectly
      impartial standpoint, I should imagine that the present policy may have to
      alter considerably!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Jost recoiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Impossible! It cannot be altered!" he said roughly,&mdash;then suddenly
      recollecting himself, he assumed his usual indolent equanimity, and rising
      slowly, went to a side door in the room and threw it open.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Step in here," he said; "We can talk without fear of interruption. Will
      you smoke?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "With pleasure!" replied Leroy, accepting a cigar from the case Jost
      extended&mdash;then glancing with a slight smile at the broad, squat
      Jewish countenance which had, in the last couple of minutes, lost
      something of its habitual redness, he added&mdash;"I am glad you are
      disposed to discuss matters with me in a friendly, as well as in a
      confidential way. It is possible my news may not be altogether agreeable
      to you;&mdash;but of course you would be more willing to suffer
      personally, than to jeopardise the honour of Ministers."
    </p>
    <p>
      He uttered the last sentence more as a question than a statement.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jost shifted one foot against the other uneasily.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am not so sure of that," he said after a pause, during which he had
      drawn himself up, and had endeavoured to look conscientious; "You see I
      have the public to consider! Ministers may fall; statesmen may be thrown
      out of office; but the Press is the same yesterday, to-day, and for ever!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Except when a great Editor changes his opinions," said Leroy tranquilly,&mdash;"Which
      is, of course, always a point of reason and conscience, as well as of&mdash;advantage!
      In the present case I think&mdash;but&mdash;shall we not enter the sanctum
      of which you have so obligingly opened the door? We can scarcely be too
      private when the King's name is in question!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Jost opened his furtive eyes in amazement.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The King? What the devil has he to do with anything but his women and his
      amusements?"
    </p>
    <p>
      A very close observer might have seen a curious expression flicker over
      Pasquin Leroy's face at these words,&mdash;an expression half of laughter,
      half of scorn,&mdash;but it was slight and evanescent, and his reply was
      frigidly courteous.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I really cannot inform you; but I am afraid his Majesty is departing
      somewhat from his customary routine! He is, in fact, taking an active,
      instead of a passive part in national affairs."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then he must be warned off the ground!" said Jost irritably; "He is a
      Constitutional monarch, and must obey the laws of the Constitution."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Precisely!" And Leroy looked carefully at the end of his cigar; "But at
      present he appears to have an idea that the laws of the Constitution are
      being tampered with by certain other kings;&mdash;for example,&mdash;the
      kings of finance!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Jost muttered a half-inaudible oath.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come this way," he said impatiently;&mdash;"Bad news is best soon over!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Leroy gave a careless nod of acquiescence,&mdash;then glancing round the
      room, up at the clock, and down again to Jost's desk, strewn with letters
      and documents of every description, he smiled a little to himself, and
      followed the all-powerful editor into the smaller adjoining apartment. The
      door closed behind them both, and Jost turned the key in the lock from
      within.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a long time all was very silent. Jost's valet and confidential
      servant, sleepy and tired, waited in the hall to let his master's visitor
      out,&mdash;and hearing no sound, ventured to look into the study now and
      then,&mdash;but to no purpose. He knew the sanctity of that inner chamber
      beyond; he knew that when the Premier came to see the great Jost,&mdash;as
      he often did,&mdash;it was in that mysterious further room that business
      was transacted, and that it was as much as his place was worth to venture
      even to knock at the door. So, yawning heavily, he dozed on his bench in
      the hall,&mdash;woke with a start and dozed again,&mdash;while the clock
      slowly ticked away the minutes till with a dull clang the hour struck One.
      Then on again went the steady and wearisome tick-tick of the pendulum, for
      a quarter of an hour, half an hour,&mdash;and three-quarters,&mdash;till
      the utterly fatigued valet was about to knock down a few walking-sticks
      and umbrellas, and make a general noise of reminder to his master as to
      how the time was going, when, to his great relief, he heard the inner door
      open at last, and the voice of the mysterious visitor ring out in clear,
      precise accents.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing will be done publicly, of course,&mdash;unless Parliament insists
      on an enquiry!" The speaker came towards the hall, and the valet sprang up
      from his bench, and stood ready to show the stranger out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jost replied, and his accents were thick and unsteady.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Enquiry cannot be forced! The Marquis himself can burk any such attempt."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But&mdash;if the King should insist?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He would be breaking all the rules of custom and precedent," said Jost,&mdash;"And
      he would deserve to be dethroned!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Pasquin Leroy laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "True! Good-night, Mr. Jost! Can I do anything for you in Moscow?" The two
      men now came into the full light shed by the great lamp in the hall. Jost
      looked darkly red in the face&mdash;almost apoplectic; Leroy was as cool,
      imperturbable and easy of manner as a practised detective or professional
      spy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In Moscow," Jost repeated&mdash;"You are going straight to Russia?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think so."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I suppose you are in the secret service?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Exactly! A curious line of business, too, which the outside world knows
      very little of. Ah!&mdash;if the excellent people&mdash;the masses as we
      call them&mdash;knew what rogues had the ruling of their affairs in some
      countries&mdash;not in this country, of course!" he added with a quizzical
      smile,&mdash;"but in some others, not very far away, I wonder how many
      revolutions would break out within six months! Good-night, Mr. Jost!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good-night!" responded Jost briefly. "You will let me know any further
      developments?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Most assuredly!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The servant opened the door, and Pasquin Leroy slipped a gold coin worth a
      sovereign into his hand, whereupon, of course, the worthy domestic
      considered him to be a 'real gentleman.' As soon as he had passed into the
      street, and the door was shut and barred for the night, Jost bade his man
      go to bed, a command which was gladly obeyed; and re-entering his study,
      passed all the time till the breaking of dawn in rummaging out letters and
      documents from various desks, drawers and despatch-boxes, and burning them
      carefully one by one in the open grate. While thus employed, he had a
      truly villainous aspect,&mdash;each flame he kindled with each paper
      seemed to show up a more unpleasing expression on his countenance, till at
      last,&mdash;when such matter was destroyed as he had at present determined
      on,&mdash;he drew himself up and stood for a moment surveying the pile of
      light black ashes, which was all that was left of about a hundred or more
      incriminating paper witnesses to certain matters in which he had more than
      a lawful interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It will be difficult now to trace my hand in the scheme!" he said to
      himself, frowning heavily, as he considered various uncomfortable
      contingencies arising out of his conversation with his late visitor. "If
      the thunderbolt falls, it will crush Carl Pérousse&mdash;not me. Yes! It
      means ruin for him&mdash;ruin and disgrace&mdash;but for me&mdash;well! I
      shall find it as easy to damn Pérousse as it has been to support him, for
      he cannot involve me without adding tenfold to his own disaster! I think
      it will be safe enough for me&mdash;possibly not so safe for the Premier.
      However, I will write to him to-morrow, just to let him know I received
      his messenger."
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meantime, while David Jost was thus cogitating unpleasant and even
      dangerous possibilities, which were perhaps on the eve of occurring to
      himself and certain of his associates in politics and journalism, Pasquin
      Leroy was hurrying along the city streets under the light of a clear,
      though pallid and waning moon. Few wanderers were abroad; the police
      walked their various rounds, and one or two miserable women passed him,
      like flying ghosts in the thin air of night. His mind was in a turmoil of
      agitation; and the thoughts that were tossing rapidly through his brain
      one upon the other, were such as he had never known before. He had
      fathomed a depth of rascality and deception, which but a short month ago,
      he could scarcely have believed capable of existence. The cruel injury and
      loss preparing for thousands of innocent persons through the
      self-interested plotting of a few men, was almost incalculable,&mdash;and
      his blood burned with passionate indignation as he realized on what a
      verge of misery, bloodshed, disaster and crime the unthinking people of
      the country stood, pushed to the very edge of a fall by the shameless and
      unscrupulous designs of a few financiers, playing their gambling game with
      the public confidence,&mdash;and cheating nations as callously as they
      would have cheated their partners at cards.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank God, it is not too late!" he murmured; "Not quite too late to save
      the situation!&mdash;to rescue the people from long years of undeserved
      taxation, loss of trade and general distress! It is a supreme task that
      has been given me to accomplish!&mdash;but if there is any truth and right
      in the laws of the Universe, I shall surely not be misjudged while
      accomplishing it!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He quickened his pace;&mdash;and to avoid going up one of the longer
      thoroughfares which led to the citadel and palace, he decided to cross one
      of the many picturesque bridges, arched over certain inlets from the sea,
      and forming canals, where barges and other vessels might be towed up to
      the very doors of the warehouses which received their cargoes. But just as
      he was about to turn in the necessary direction, he halted abruptly at
      sight of two men, standing at the first corner in the way of his advance,
      talking earnestly. He recognized them at once as Sergius Thord and the
      half-inebriated poet, Paul Zouche. With noiseless step he moved cautiously
      into the broad stretch of black shadow cast by the great façade of a block
      of buildings which occupied half the length of the street in which he
      stood, and so managing to slip into the denser darkness of a doorway, was
      able to hear what they were saying. The full, mellow, and persuasive tone
      of Thord's voice had something in it of reproach.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You shame yourself, Zouche!" he said; "You shame me; you shame us all!
      Man, did God put a light of Genius in your soul merely to be quenched by
      the cravings of a bestial body? What associate are you for us? How can you
      help us in the fulfilment of our ideal dream? By day you mingle with
      litterateurs, scientists, and philosophers,&mdash;report has it that you
      have even managed to stumble your way into my lady's boudoir;&mdash;but by
      night you wander like this,&mdash;insensate, furious, warped in soul,
      muddled in brain, and only the heart of you alive,&mdash;the poor
      unsatisfied heart&mdash;hungering and crying for what itself makes
      impossible!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Zouche broke into a harsh laugh. Turning up his head to the sky, he thrust
      back his wild hair, and showed his thin eager face and glittering eyes,
      outlined cameo-like by the paling radiance of the moon.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well spoken, my Sergius!" he exclaimed. "You always speak well! Your
      thoughts are of flame&mdash;your speech is of gold; the fire melts the
      ore! And then again you have a conscience! That is a strange possession!&mdash;quite
      useless in these days, like the remains of the tail we had when we were
      all happy apes in the primeval forest, pelting the Megatherium or other
      such remarkable beasts with cocoanuts! It was a much better life, Sergius,
      believe me! A Conscience is merely a mental Appendicitis! There should be
      a psychical surgeon with an airy lancet to cut it out. Not for me!&mdash;I
      was born perfect&mdash;without it!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He laughed again, then with an abrupt change of manner he caught Thord
      violently by the arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How can you speak of shame?" he said&mdash;"What shame is left in either
      man or woman nowadays? Naked to the very skin of foulness, they flaunt a
      nudity of vice in every public thoroughfare! Your sentiments, my grand
      Sergius, are those of an old world long passed away! You are a reformer, a
      lover of truth&mdash;a hater of shams&mdash;and in the days when the
      people loved truth,&mdash;and wanted justice,&mdash;and fought for both,
      you would have been great! But greatness is nowadays judged as 'madness'&mdash;truth
      as 'want of tact'&mdash;desire for justice is 'clamour for notoriety.'
      Shame? There is no shame in anything, Sergius, but honesty! That is a
      disgrace to the century; for an honest man is always poor, and poverty is
      the worst of crimes." He threw up his arms with a wild gesture,&mdash;"The
      worst of crimes! Do I not know it!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Thord took him gently by the shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You talk, Zouche, as you always talk, at random, scarcely knowing, and
      certainly not half meaning what you say. There is no real reason in your
      rages against fate and fortune. Leave the accursed drink, and you may
      still win the prize you covet&mdash;Fame."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not I!" said Zouche scornfully,&mdash;"Fame in its original sense
      belonged also to the growing-time of the world&mdash;when, proud of youth
      and the glow of life, the full-fledged man judged himself immortal. Fame
      now is adjudged to the biped-machine who drives a motor-car best,&mdash;or
      to the fortunate soap-boiler who dines with a king! Poetry is understood
      to be the useful rhyme which announces the virtues of pills and
      boot-blacking! Mark you, Sergius!&mdash;my latest volume was 'graciously
      accepted by the King'! Do you know what that means?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," replied Thord, a trifle coldly; "And if it were not that I know your
      strange vagaries, I should say you wronged your election as one of us, to
      send any of your work to a crowned fool!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Zouche laughed discordantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You would? No, you would not, my Sergius, if you knew the spirit in which
      I sent it! A spirit as wild, as reckless, as ranting, as defiant as ever
      devil indulged in! The humility of my presentation letter to his Majesty
      was beautiful! The reply of the flunkey-secretary was equally beautiful in
      smug courtesy: 'Sir, I am commanded by the King to thank you for the book
      of poems you have kindly sent for his acceptance!' I say again, Thord, do
      you know what it means?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No; I only wish that instead of talking here, you would let me see you
      safely home."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Home! I have no home! Since <i>she</i> died&mdash;" He paused, and a grey
      shadow crossed his face like the hue of approaching sickness or death. "I
      killed her, poor child! Of course you know that! I neglected her,&mdash;deserted
      her&mdash;left her to die! Well! She is only one more added to the list of
      countless women martyrs who have been tortured out of an unjust world&mdash;and
      now&mdash;now I write verses to her memory!" He shivered as with cold,
      still clinging to Thord's arm. "But I did not tell you what great good
      comes of sending a book to the King! It means less to a writer than to a
      boot-maker. For the boot-maker can put up a sign: 'Special Fitter for the
      ease of His Majesty's Corns'&mdash;but if a poet should say his verse is
      'accepted' by a monarch, the shrewd public take it at once to be bad
      verse, and will have none of it! That is the case with my book to-day!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why did you send it?" asked Thord, with grave patience. "Your business
      with kings is to warn, not to flatter!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just so!" cried Zouche; "And if His Most Gracious and Glorious had been
      pleased to look inside the volume, he would have seen enough to startle
      him! It was sent in hate, my Sergius,&mdash;not in humility,&mdash;just as
      the flunkey-secretary's answer was penned in derision, aping courtesy! How
      you look, under this wan sky of night! Reproachful, yet pitying, as the
      eyes of Buddha are your eyes, my Sergius! You are a fine fellow&mdash;your
      brain is a dome decorated with glorious ideals!&mdash;and yet you are like
      all of us, weak in one point, as Achilles in the heel. One thing could
      turn you from man into beast&mdash;and that would be if Lotys loved&mdash;not
      you&mdash;she never will love you&mdash;but another!"&mdash;Thord started
      back as though suddenly stabbed, and angrily shook off his companion, who
      only laughed again,&mdash;a shrill, echoing laugh in which there was a
      note of madness and desolation. "Bah!" he exclaimed; "You are a fool after
      all! You work for a woman as I did&mdash;once! But mark you!&mdash;do not
      kill her&mdash;as I did&mdash;once! Be patient! Watch the light shine,
      even though it does not illumine your path; be glad that the rose blooms
      for itself, if not for you! It will be difficult!&mdash;meanwhile you can
      live on hope&mdash;a bitter fruit to eat; but gnaw it to the last rind, my
      Sergius! Hope that Lotys may melt in your fire, as a snowflake in the sun!
      Come! Now take the poor poet home,&mdash;the drunken child of inspiration&mdash;take
      him home to his garret in the slums&mdash;the poet whose book has been
      accepted by the King!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Pulling himself up from his semi-crouching position, he seized Thord's arm
      again more tightly, and began to walk along unsteadily. Presently he
      paused, smiling vacantly up at the gradually vanishing stars.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lotys speaks to our followers on Saturday," he said; "You know that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Thord bent his head in acquiescence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will be there, of course. I shall be there! What a voice she has!
      Whether we believe what she says or not, we must hear,&mdash;and hearing,
      we must follow. Where shall we drink in the sweet Oracle this time?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "At the People's Assembly Rooms," responded Thord; "But remember, Zouche,
      she does not speak till nine o'clock. That means that you will be unfit to
      listen!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You think so?" responded Zouche airily, and leaning on Thord he stumbled
      onward, the two passing close in front of the doorway where Pasquin Leroy
      stood concealed. "But I am more ready to understand wisdom when drunk,
      than when sober, my Sergius! You do not understand. I am a human
      eccentricity&mdash;the result of an <i>amour</i> between a fiend and an
      angel! Believe me! I will listen to Lotys with all my devil-saintly soul,&mdash;you
      will listen to her with all your loving, longing heart&mdash;and with us
      two thus attentive, the opinions of the rest of the audience will scarcely
      matter! How the street reels! How the old moon dances! So did she whirl
      pallidly when Antony clasped his Egyptian Queen, and lost Actium! Remember
      the fate of Antony, Sergius! Kingdoms would have been seized and
      controlled by men such as you are, long before now&mdash;if there had not
      always been a woman in the case&mdash;a Cleopatra&mdash;or a Lotys!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Still laughing foolishly, he reeled onwards, Sergius Thord
      half-supporting, half-leading him, with grave carefulness and brotherly
      compassion. They were soon out of sight; and Pasquin Leroy, leaving his
      dark hiding-place, crossed the bridge with an alert step, and mounted a
      steep street leading to the citadel. From gaps between the tall leaning
      houses a glimpse of the sea, silvered by the dying moonlight, flashed now
      and again; and in the silence of the night the low ripple of small waves
      against the breakwater could be distinctly heard. A sense of holy calm
      impressed him as he paused a moment; and the words of an old monkish verse
      came back to him from some far-off depth of memory:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Lord Christ, I would my soul were clear as air,
  With only Thy pure radiance falling through!
</pre>
    <p>
      He caught his breath hard&mdash;there was a smarting sense as of tears in
      his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So proudly throned, and so unloved!" he muttered. "Yet,&mdash;has not the
      misprisal and miscomprehension been merited? Whose is the blame? Not with
      the People, who, despite the prophet's warning, 'still put their trust in
      princes'&mdash;but with the falsity and hollowness of the system!
      Sovereignty is like an old ship stuck fast in the docks, and unfit for
      sailing the wide seas&mdash;crusted with barnacles of custom and
      prejudice,&mdash;and in every gale of wind pulling and straining at a
      rusty chain anchor. But the spirit of Change is in the world; a hurrying
      movement that has wings of fire, and might possibly be called Revolution!
      It is better that the torch should be lighted from the Throne than from
      the slums!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He went on his way quickly,&mdash;till reaching the outer wall of the
      citadel, he was challenged by a sentinel, to whom he gave the password in
      a low tone. The man drew back, satisfied, and Leroy went on, mounting from
      point to point of the cliff, till he reached a private gate leading into
      the wide park-lands which skirted the King's palace. Here stood a muffled
      and cloaked figure evidently watching for him; for as soon as he appeared
      the gate was noiselessly opened for his admittance, and he passed in at
      once. Then he and the person who had awaited his coming, walked together
      through the scented woods of pine and rhododendrons, and talking in low
      and confidential voices, slowly disappeared.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIV. &mdash; THE KING'S VETO
    </h2>
    <p>
      The Marquis de Lutera was a heavy sleeper, and for some time had been
      growing stouter than was advisable for the dignity of a Prime Minister. He
      had been defeated of late years in one or two important measures; and his
      colleague, Carl Pérousse, had by gradual degrees succeeded in worming
      himself into such close connection with the rest of the members of the
      Cabinet, that he, Lutera, felt himself being edged out, not only from
      political 'deals,' but from the profits appertaining thereto. So, growing
      somewhat indifferent, as well as disgusted at the course affairs were
      taking, he had made up his mind to retire from office, as soon as he had
      carried through a certain Bill which, in its results, would have the
      effect of crippling the people of the country, while helping on his own
      interests to a considerable degree. At the immediate moment he had a
      chance of looming large on the political horizon. Carl Pérousse could not
      do anything of very great importance without him; they were both too
      deeply involved together in the same schemes. In point of fact, if
      Pérousse could bring the Premier to a fall, the Premier could do the same
      by Pérousse. The two depended on each other; and Lutera, conscious that if
      Pérousse gained any fresh accession of power, it would be to his,
      Lutera's, advantage, was gradually preparing to gracefully resign his
      position in the younger and more ambitious man's favour. But he was not
      altogether comfortable in his mind since his last interview with the King.
      The King had shown unusual signs of self-will and obstinacy. He had
      presumed to give a command affecting the national policy; and, moreover,
      he had threatened, if his command were not obeyed, to address Parliament
      himself on the subject in hand, from the Throne. Such an unaccustomed,
      unconstitutional idea was very upsetting to the Premier's mind. It had
      cost him a sleepless night; and when he woke to a new day's work, he was
      in an extremely irritable humour. He was doubtful how to act;&mdash;for to
      complain of the King would not do; and to enlighten the members of the
      Cabinet as to his Majesty's declared determination to dispose amicably of
      certain difficulties with a foreign power, which the Ministry had fully
      purposed fanning up into a flame of war, might possibly awaken a storm of
      dissension and discussion.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We all want money!" said the Marquis gloomily, as he rose from his
      tumbled bed to take his first breakfast, and read his early morning
      letters&mdash;"And to crush a small and insolent race, whose country is
      rich in mineral product, is simply the act of squeezing an orange for the
      necessary juice. Life would be lost, of course, but we are over-populated;
      and a good war would rid the country of many scamps and vagabonds. Widows
      and orphans could be provided for by national subscriptions, invested as
      the Ministry think fit, and paid to applicants after about twenty years'
      waiting!" He smiled sardonically. "The gain to ourselves would be
      incalculable; new wealth, new schemes, new openings for commerce and
      speculation in every way! And now the King sets himself up as an obstacle
      to progress! If he were fond of money, we could explain the whole big
      combine, and offer him a share;&mdash;but with a character such as he
      possesses, I doubt if it would work! With some monarchs whom I could name,
      it would be perfectly easy. And yet,&mdash;for the three years he has been
      on the throne, he has been passive enough,&mdash;asking no questions,&mdash;signing
      such documents as he has been told to sign,&mdash;uttering such speeches
      as have been written for him,&mdash;and I was never more shocked and taken
      aback in my life than yesterday morning, when he declared he had decided
      to think and act for himself! Simply preposterous! An ordinary man who
      presumes to think and act for himself is always a danger to the community&mdash;but
      a king! Good Heavens! We should have the old feudal system back again."
    </p>
    <p>
      He sipped his coffee leisurely, and opened a few letters; there were none
      of very pressing importance. He was just about to glance through the
      morning's newspaper, when his man-servant entered bearing a note marked
      'Private and Immediate.' He recognized the handwriting of David Jost.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Anyone waiting for an answer?" he enquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, Excellency."
    </p>
    <p>
      The man retired. The Marquis broke the large splotchy seal bearing the
      coat-of-arms which Jost affected, but to which he had no more right than
      the man in the moon, and read what seemed to him more inexplicable than
      the most confusing conundrum ever invented.
    </p>
    <p>
      "MY DEAR MARQUIS,&mdash;I received your confidential messenger last night,
      and explained the entire situation. He left for Moscow this morning, but
      will warn us of any further developments. Sorry matters look so grave for
      you. Should like a few minutes private chat when you can spare the time.&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yours truly, DAVID JOST."
    </p>
    <p>
      Over and over again the Marquis read this brief note, staring at its every
      word and utterly unable to understand its meaning.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What in the world is the fellow driving at!" he exclaimed angrily&mdash;"'My
      messenger'! 'Explained the entire situation'! The devil! 'Left for
      Moscow'! Upon my soul, this is maddening!" And he rang the bell sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who brought this note?" he asked, as his servant entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Jost's own man, Excellency."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Has he gone?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, Excellency."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wait!" And sitting down he wrote hastily the following lines:
    </p>
    <p>
      "DEAR SIR,&mdash;Your letter is inexplicable. I sent no messenger to you
      last night. If you have any explanation to offer, I shall be disengaged
      and alone till 11.30 this morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yours truly,&mdash;DE LUTERA."
    </p>
    <p>
      Folding, sealing, and addressing this, he marked it 'Private' and gave it
      to his man.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Take this yourself," he said, "and put it into Mr. Jost's own hands.
      Trust no one to deliver it. Ask to see him personally, and then give it to
      him. You understand?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, Excellency."
    </p>
    <p>
      His note thus despatched, the Marquis threw himself down in his arm-chair,
      and again read Jost's mysterious communication.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Whatever messenger has passed himself off as coming from me, Jost must
      have been crazy to receive him without credentials," he said. "There must
      be a mistake somewhere!"
    </p>
    <p>
      A vague alarm troubled him; he was not moved by conscientious scruples,
      but the idea that any of his secret moves should be 'explained' to a
      stranger was, to say the least of it, annoying, and not conducive to the
      tranquillity of his mind. A thousand awkward possibilities suggested
      themselves at once to his brain, and as he carried a somewhat excitable
      disposition under his heavy and phlegmatic exterior, he fumed and fretted
      himself for the next half hour into an impatience which only found vent in
      the prosaic and everyday performance of dressing himself. Ah!&mdash;if
      those who consider a Prime Minister great and exalted, could only see him
      as he pulls on his trousers, and fastens his shirt collar, what a
      disillusion would be promptly effected! Especially if, like the Marquis de
      Lutera, he happened to be over-stout, and difficult to clothe! This
      particular example of Premiership was an ungainly man; his proud position
      could not make him handsome, nor lend true dignity to his deportment. Old
      Mother Nature has a way of marking her specimens, if we will learn to
      recognize the signs she sets on certain particular 'makes' of man. The
      Marquis de Lutera was 'made' to be a stock-jobber, not a statesman. His
      bent was towards the material gain and good of himself, more than the
      advantage of his country. His reasoning was a slight variation of
      Falstaff's logical misprisal of honour. He argued; "If I am poor, then
      what is it to me that others are rich? If I am neglected, what do I care
      that the people are prosperous? Let me but secure and keep those certain
      millions of money which shall ensure to me and my heritage a handsome
      endowment, not only for my life, but for all lives connected with mine
      which come after me,&mdash;and my 'patriotism' is satisfied!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He had just finished insinuating himself by degrees into his morning coat,
      when his servant entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well!" he asked impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Jost is coming round at once, Excellency. He ordered his carriage
      directly he read your note."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He sent no answer?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "None, Excellency."
    </p>
    <p>
      "When he arrives, show him into the library."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, Excellency."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Marquis thereupon left his sleeping apartment, and descended to the
      library himself. The sun was streaming brilliantly into the room, and the
      windows, thrown wide open, showed a cheerful display of lawn and
      flower-garden, filled with palms and other semi-tropical shrubs, for
      though the Premier's house was in the centre of the fashionable quarter of
      the city, it had the advantage of extensive and well-shaded grounds. A law
      had been passed in the late King's time against the felling of trees, it
      having been scientifically proved that trees in a certain quantity, not
      only purify the air from disease germs affecting the human organization,
      but also save the crops from many noxious insect-pests and poisonous
      fungi. Having learned the lesson at last, that the Almighty may be trusted
      to know His own business, and that trees are intended for wider purposes
      than mere timber, the regulations were strict concerning them. No one
      could fell a tree on his own ground without, first of all, making a
      statement at the National Office of Aboriculture as to the causes for its
      removal; and only if these causes were found satisfactory, could a stamped
      permission be obtained for cutting it down or 'lifting' it to other
      ground. The result of this sensible regulation was that in the hottest
      days of summer the city was kept cool and shady by the rich foliage
      branching out everywhere, and in some parts running into broad avenues and
      groves of great thickness and beauty. The Marquis de Lutera's garden had
      an additional charm in a beautiful alley of orange trees, and the
      fragrance wafted into his room from the delicious blossoms would have
      refreshed and charmed anyone less troubled, worried and feverish, than he
      was at the time. But this morning the very sunshine annoyed him;&mdash;never
      a great lover of Nature, the trees and flowers forming the outlook on
      which his heavy eyes rested were almost an affront. The tranquil beauty of
      an ever renewed and renewing Nature is always particularly offensive to an
      uneasy conscience and an exhausted mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sound of wheels grinding along the outer drive brought a faint gleam
      of satisfaction on his brooding features, and he turned sharply round, as
      the door of the library was thrown open to admit Jost, whose appearance,
      despite his jaunty manner, betokened evident confusion and alarm.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good-morning, Mr. Jost!" said the Marquis stiffly, as his confidential
      man ushered in the visitor,&mdash;then when the servant had retired and
      closed the door, he added quickly&mdash;"Now what does this mean?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Jost dropped into a chair, and pulling out a handkerchief wiped the
      perspiration from his brow.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know!" he said helplessly; "I don't know what it means! I have
      told you the truth! A man came to see me late last night, saying he was
      sent by you on urgent business. He said you wished me to explain the
      position we held, and the amount of the interests we had at stake, as
      there were grave discoveries pending, and complexities likely to ensue. He
      gave his name&mdash;there is his card!"
    </p>
    <p>
      And with a semi-groan, he threw down the bit of pasteboard in question.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Marquis snatched it up.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Pasquin Leroy'! I never heard the name in my life," he said fiercely.
      "Jost, you have been done! You mean to tell me you were such a fool as to
      trust an entire stranger with the whole financial plan of campaign, and
      that you were credulous enough to believe that he came from me&mdash;me&mdash;De
      Lutera,&mdash;without any credentials?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Credentials!" exclaimed Jost; "Do you suppose I would have received him
      at all had credentials been lacking? Not I! He brought me the most sure
      and confidential sign of your trust that could be produced&mdash;your own
      signet-ring!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The Marquis staggered back, as though Jost's words had been so many direct
      blows on the chest,&mdash;his countenance turned a livid white.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My signet-ring!" he repeated,&mdash;and almost unconsciously he looked at
      the hand from which the great jewel was missing; "My signet!"&mdash;Then
      he forced a smile&mdash;"Jost, I repeat, you have been done!&mdash;doubly
      fooled!&mdash;no one could possibly have obtained my signet,&mdash;for at
      this very moment it is on the hand of the King!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Jost rose slowly out of his chair, his eyes protruding out of his head,
      his jaw almost dropping in the extremity of his amazement.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The King!"&mdash;he gasped&mdash;"The King!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, man, the King!" repeated De Lutera impatiently,&mdash;"Only
      yesterday morning his Majesty, having mislaid his own ring for the moment,
      borrowed mine just before starting on his yachting cruise. How you stare!
      You have been fooled!&mdash;that is perfectly plain and evident!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The King!" repeated Jost stupidly&mdash;"Then the man who came to me last
      night&mdash;" He broke off, unable to find any words for the expression of
      the thoughts which began to terrify him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well!&mdash;the man who came to you last night," echoed the Marquis,&mdash;"He
      was not the King, I suppose, was he?" And he laughed derisively.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No&mdash;he was not the King," said Jost slowly; "I know <i>him</i> well
      enough! But it might have been someone in the King's service! For he knew,
      or said he knew, the King's intentions in a certain matter affecting both
      you and Carl Pérousse,&mdash;and in a more distant way, myself&mdash;and
      warned me of a coming change in the policy. Ah!&mdash;it is now your turn
      to stare, Marquis! You had best be on your guard, for if the person who
      came to me last night was not your messenger, he was the King's spy! And,
      in that case, we are lost!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The Marquis paced the room with long uneven strides,&mdash;his mind was
      greatly agitated, but he had no wish to show his perturbation too openly
      to one whom he considered as a mere tool in his service.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know," went on Jost emphatically, "that the ring he wore was yours! I
      noticed it particularly while I was talking to him. It would take a long
      time and exceptional skill to make any imitation of that sapphire. There
      is no doubt that it was your signet!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The Premier halted suddenly in his nervous walk.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You told him the whole scheme, you say?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I did."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And his reply?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Was, that the King had discovered it, and proposed insisting on an
      enquiry."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And then?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well! Then he warned me to look out for myself,&mdash;as anyone connected
      with Carl Pérousse's financial deal would inevitably be ruined during the
      next few weeks."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who is going to work the ruin?" asked the Marquis with a sneer; "Do you
      not know that if the King dared to give an opinion on a national crisis,
      he would be dethroned?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "There are the People&mdash;" began Jost.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The People! Human emmets&mdash;born for crushing under the heel of power!
      A couple of 'leaders' in your paper, Jost, can guide the fool-mob any
      way!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That depends!" said Jost hesitatingly; "If what the fellow said last
      night be true&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is not true!" said the Premier authoritatively. "We are going on in
      precisely the same course as originally arranged. Neither King nor People
      can interfere! Go home, and write an article about love of country, Jost!
      You look in the humour for it!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The Jew's expression was anything but amiable.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is to be done about last night?" he asked sullenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing at present. I am going to the palace at two o'clock&mdash;I shall
      see the King, and find out whether my signet is lost, stolen or strayed.
      Meanwhile, keep your own counsel! If you have been betrayed into giving
      your confidence to a spy in the foreign service, as I imagine&mdash;(for
      the King has never employed a spy, and is not likely to do so), and he
      makes known his information, it can be officially denied. The official
      denial of a Government, Jost, like charity, has before now covered a
      multitude of sins!"
    </p>
    <p>
      An instinctive disinclination for further conversation brought the
      interview between them abruptly to a close, and Jost, full of a suspicious
      alarm, which he was ashamed to confess, drove off to his newspaper
      offices. The Premier, meantime, though harassed by secret anxiety, managed
      to display his usual frigid equanimity, when, after Jost's departure, his
      private secretary arrived at the customary time, to transact under his
      orders the correspondence and business of the day. This secretary, Eugène
      Silvano by name, was a quiet self-contained young man, highly ambitious,
      and keenly interested in the political situation, and, though in the
      Premier's service, not altogether of his way of thinking. He called the
      Marquis's attention now to a letter that had missed careful reading on the
      previous day. It was from the Vicar-General of the Society of Jesus,
      expressing surprise and indignation that the King should have refused the
      Society's request for such land as was required to be devoted to religious
      and educational purposes, and begging that the Premier would exert his
      influence with the monarch to persuade him to withdraw or mitigate his
      refusal.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can do nothing;" said the Marquis irritably,&mdash;"the lands they want
      belong to the Crown. The King can dispose of them as he thinks best."
    </p>
    <p>
      The secretary set the letter aside.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Shall I reply to that effect?" he enquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Marquis nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know," said Silvano presently with a slight hesitation, "that you never
      pay any attention to anonymous communications. Otherwise, there is one
      here which might merit consideration."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What does it concern?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A revolutionary meeting," replied Silvano, "where it appears the woman,
      Lotys, is to speak."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Premier shrugged his shoulders and smiled. "You must enlighten me! Who
      is the woman Lotys?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, that no one exactly knows!" replied the secretary. "A strange
      character, without doubt, but&mdash;" He paused and spoke more
      emphatically&mdash;"She has power!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Lutera gave a gesture of irritation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bah! Over whom does she exercise it. Over one man or many?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Over one half the population at least," responded Silvano, quietly,
      turning over a few papers without looking up.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Marquis stared at him, slightly amused.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you taken statistics of the lady's followers," he asked; "Are you
      one of them yourself?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Silvano raised his eyes,&mdash;clear dark eyes, deep-set and steady in
      their glance.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Were I so, I should not be here;" he replied&mdash;"But I know how she
      speaks; I know what she does! and from a purely political point of view I
      think it unwise to ignore her."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is this anonymous communication you speak of?" asked the Premier,
      after a pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, it is brief enough," answered Silvano unfolding a paper, and he read
      aloud:
    </p>
    <p>
      "To the Marquis de Lutera, Premier.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Satisfy yourself that those who meet on Saturday night where Lotys
      speaks, have already decided on your downfall!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oracular!" said the Marquis carelessly;&mdash;"To decide is one thing&mdash;to
      fulfil the decision is another! Lotys, whoever she may be, can preach to
      her heart's content, for all I care! I am rather surprised, Silvano, that
      a man of your penetration and intelligence should attach any importance to
      revolutionary meetings, which are always going on more or less in every
      city under the sun. Why, it was but the other day, the police were sent to
      disperse a crowd which had gathered round the fanatic, Sergius Thord; only
      the people had sufficient sense to disperse themselves. A street-preacher
      or woman ranter is like a cheap-jack or a dispenser of quack medicines;&mdash;the
      mob gathers to such persons out of curiosity, not conviction."
    </p>
    <p>
      The secretary made no reply, and went on with other matters awaiting his
      attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      At a few minutes before two o'clock the Marquis entered his carriage, and
      was driven to the palace. There he learned that the King was receiving,
      more or less unofficially, certain foreign ambassadors and noblemen of
      repute in the Throne-room. A fine band was playing military music in the
      great open quadrangle in front of the palace, where pillars of
      rose-marble, straight as the stems of pine-trees, held up fabulous
      heraldic griffins, clasping between their paws the country's shield. Flags
      were flying,&mdash;fountains flashing,&mdash;gay costumes gleamed here and
      there,&mdash;and the atmosphere was full of brilliancy and gaiety,&mdash;yet
      the Marquis, on his way to the audience-chamber, was rendered
      uncomfortably aware of one of those mysterious impressions which are
      sometimes conveyed to us, we know not how, but which tend to prepare us
      for surprise and disappointment. Some extra fibre of sensitiveness in his
      nervous organization was acutely touched, for he actually fancied he saw
      slighting and indifferent looks on the faces of the various flunkeys and
      retainers who bowed him along the different passages, or ushered him up
      the state stairway, when&mdash;as a matter of fact,&mdash;all was
      precisely the same as usual, and it was only his own conscience that gave
      imaginary hints of change. Arrived at the ante-chamber to the Throne-room,
      he was surprised to find Prince Humphry there, talking animatedly to the
      King's physician, Professor Von Glauben. The Prince seemed unusually
      excited; his face was flushed, and his eyes extraordinarily brilliant, and
      as he saw the Premier, he came forward, extending his hand, and almost
      preventing Lutera's profound bow and deferential salutation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you business with the King, Marquis?" enquired the young man with a
      light laugh. "If you have, you must do as I am doing,&mdash;wait his
      Majesty's pleasure!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The Premier lifted his eyebrows, smiled deprecatingly, and murmuring
      something about pressure of State affairs, shook hands with Von Glauben,
      whose countenance, as usual, presented an impenetrable mask to his
      thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is rather a new experience for me," continued the Prince, "to be
      treated as a kind of petitioner on the King's favour, and kept in
      attendance,&mdash;but no matter!&mdash;novelty is always pleasing! I have
      been cooling my heels here for more than an hour. Von Glauben, too, has
      been waiting;&mdash;contrary to custom, he has not even been permitted to
      enquire after his Majesty's health this morning!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Lutera maintained his former expression of polite surprise, but said
      nothing. Instinct warned him to be sparing of words lest he should betray
      his own private anxiety.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Prince went on carelessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Majesty takes humours like other men, and must, more than other men, I
      suppose, be humoured! Yet there is to my mind something unnatural in a
      system which causes several human beings to be dependent on another's
      caprice!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will not say so, Sir, when you yourself are King," observed the
      Marquis.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Long distant be the day!" returned the Prince. "Indeed, I hope it may
      never be! I would rather be the simplest peasant ploughing the fields, and
      happy in my own way, than suffer the penalties and pains surrounding the
      possession of a Throne!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Only," put in Von Glauben sententiously, "you would have to take into
      consideration, Sir, whether the peasant ploughing the fields is happy in
      his own way. I have made 'the peasant ploughing the fields' a special form
      of study,&mdash;and I have always found him a remarkably discontented,
      often ill-fed&mdash;and therefore unhealthy individual."
    </p>
    <p>
      "We are all discontented, if it comes to that!" said Prince Humphry with a
      light laugh,&mdash;"Except myself! I am perfectly contented!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have reason to be, Sir," said Lutera, bowing low.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are quite right, Marquis!&mdash;I have! More reason than perhaps you
      are aware of!"
    </p>
    <p>
      His eyes lightened and flashed; he looked unusually handsome, and the
      Premier's shifty glance rested on him for a moment with a certain
      curiosity. But he had not been accustomed to pay very much attention to
      the words or actions of the Heir-Apparent, considering him to be a very
      'ordinary' young man, without either the brilliancy or the ambition which
      should mark him out as worthy of his exalted station. And before any
      further conversation could take place, Sir Roger de Launay entered the
      room and announced to the Marquis that the King was ready to receive him.
      Prince Humphry turning sharply round, faced the equerry.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am still to wait?" he enquired, with a slight touch of hauteur.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Roger bowed respectfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your instant desire to see the King, your father, Sir, was communicated
      to his Majesty at once," he replied. "The present delay is by his
      Majesty's own orders. I much regret&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Regret nothing, my dear Sir Roger," he said. "My patience does not easily
      tire! Marquis, I trust your business will not take long?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall endeavour to make it as brief as possible, Sir," replied the
      Premier deferentially as he withdrew.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was with a certain uneasiness, however, in his mind that he followed
      Sir Roger to the Throne-room. There was no possibility of exchanging so
      much as a word with the equerry; besides, De Launay was not a talking man.
      Passing between the lines of attendants, pages, lords-in-waiting and
      others, he was conscious of a certain loss of his usual self-possession as
      he found himself at last in the presence of the King,&mdash;who, attired
      in brilliant uniform, was conversing graciously and familiarly with a
      select group of distinguished individuals whose costume betokened them as
      envoys or visitors from foreign courts in the diplomatic service.
      Perceiving the Premier, however, he paused in his conversation, and
      standing quite still awaited his approach. Then he extended his hand, with
      his usual kindly condescension. Instinctively Lutera's eyes searched that
      hand, with the expression of a guilty soul searching for a witness to its
      innocence. There shone the great sapphire&mdash;his own signet&mdash;and
      to his excited fancy its blue glimmer emitted a witch-like glow of menace.
      Meanwhile the King was speaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are just a few minutes late, Marquis!" he said; "Had you come a
      little earlier, you would have met M. Pérousse, who has matters of import
      to discuss with you." Here he moved aside from those immediately in
      hearing. "It is perhaps as well you should know I have 'vetoed' his war
      propositions. It will rest now with you, to call a Council to-morrow,&mdash;the
      next day,&mdash;or,&mdash;when you please!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Completely taken aback, the Premier was silent for a moment, biting his
      lips to keep down the torrent of rage and disappointment that threatened
      to break out in violent and unguarded speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sir!&mdash;Your Majesty! Pardon me, but surely you cannot fail to
      understand that in a Constitution like ours, the course decided upon by
      Ministers <i>cannot</i> be vetoed by the King?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The monarch smiled gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Cannot' is a weak word, Marquis! I do not include it in my vocabulary! I
      fully grant you that a plan of campaign decided upon by Ministers as you
      say, has <i>not</i> been 'vetoed' by a reigning sovereign for at least a
      couple of centuries,&mdash;and the custom has naturally fallen into
      desuetude,&mdash;but if it should be found at any time,&mdash;(I do not
      say it <i>has</i> been found) that Ministers are engaged in a seriously
      mistaken policy, and are being misled by the doubtful propositions of
      private financial speculators, so much as to consider their own advantage
      more important and valuable than the prosperity of a country or the good
      of a people,&mdash;then a king who does <i>not</i> veto the same is a
      worse criminal than those he tacitly supports and encourages!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Lutera turned a deadly white,&mdash;his eyes fell before the clear,
      straight gaze of his Sovereign,&mdash;but he said not a word.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A king's 'veto' has before now brought about a king's dethronement," went
      on the monarch; "Should it do so in my case, I shall not greatly care,&mdash;but
      if things trend that way, I shall lay my thoughts openly before the People
      for their judgment. They seldom or never hear the Sovereign whom they pay
      to keep, speak to them on a matter gravely affecting their national
      destinies,&mdash;but they shall hear <i>me</i>,&mdash;if necessary!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The Marquis moistened his dry lips, and essayed to pronounce a few words.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your Majesty will run considerable risk&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of being judged as something more than a mere dummy," said the King&mdash;"Or
      a fool set on a throne to be fooled! True! But the risk can only involve
      life,&mdash;and life is immaterial when weighed in the balance against
      Honour. By the way, Marquis, permit me to return to you this valuable
      gem";&mdash;Here drawing off the Premier's sapphire signet, he handed it
      to him&mdash;"Almost I envy it! It is a fine stone!&mdash;and worthy of
      its high service!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your Majesty has increased its value by wearing it," said Lutera,
      recovering a little of his strayed equanimity in his determination to
      probe to the bottom of the mystery which perplexed his mind. "May I ask&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Anything in reason, my dear Marquis," returned the King lightly, and
      smiling as he spoke. "A thousand questions if you like!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "One will suffice," answered the Premier. "I had an unpleasant dream last
      night about this very ring&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah!" ejaculated the King; "Did you dream that I had dropped it in the sea
      on my way to The Islands yesterday?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He spoke jestingly, yet with a kindly air, and Lutera gained courage to
      look boldly up and straight into his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I did not dream that you had lost it, Sir," he answered&mdash;"but that
      it had been stolen from your hand, and used by a spy for unlawful
      purposes!"
    </p>
    <p>
      A strange expression crossed the King's face,&mdash;a look of inward
      illumination; he smiled, but there was a quiver of strong feeling under
      the smile. Advancing a step, he laid his hand with a light, half-warning
      pressure on the Premier's shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dreams always go by contraries, Marquis!" he said;&mdash;"I assure you,
      on my honour as a king and a gentleman, that from the moment you lent it
      to me, till now,&mdash;when I return it to you,&mdash;<i>that ring has
      never left my finger</i>!"

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XV. &mdash; "MORGANATIC" OR&mdash;?
    </h2>
    <p>
      The Royal 'at home' was soon over. Many of those who had the felicity of
      breathing in the King's presence that afternoon remarked upon his
      Majesty's evident good health and high spirits, while others as freely
      commented on the unapproachableness and irritability of the Marquis de
      Lutera. Sir Walter Langton, the great English traveller, who was taking
      his leave of the Sovereign that day, being bound on an expedition to the
      innermost recesses of Africa, was not altogether agreeably impressed by
      the Premier, whom he met on this occasion for the first and only time.
      They had begun their acquaintance by talking generalities,&mdash;but
      drifted by degrees into the dangerous circle of politics, and were
      skirting round the edge of various critical questions of the day, when the
      Marquis said abruptly:
    </p>
    <p>
      "An autocracy would not flourish in your country, I presume, Sir Walter?
      The British people have been too long accustomed to sing that they 'never,
      never will be slaves.' Your Government is really more or less of a
      Republic."
    </p>
    <p>
      "All Governments are so in these days, I imagine," replied Langton.
      "Autocracy on the part of a monarch is nowhere endured, save in Russia,&mdash;and
      what is Russia? A huge volcano, smouldering with fire, and ever
      threatening to break out in flame and engulf the Throne! Monarchs were not
      always wisdom personified in olden times,&mdash;and I venture to consider
      them nowadays less wise and more careless than ever. Only a return to
      almost barbaric ignorance and superstition would tolerate any complete
      monarchical authority in these present times of progress. It is only the
      long serfdom of Russia that hinders the triumph of Liberty there, as
      elsewhere."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Marquis listened eagerly, and with evident satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I agree with you!" he said. "You consider, then, that in no country,
      under any circumstances, could the people be expected to obey their
      monarch blindly?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly not! Even Rome, with its visible spiritual Head and Sovereign,
      has no real power. It imagines it has; but let it make any decided step to
      ensnare the liberties of the people at large, and the result would be
      somewhat astonishing! Personally&mdash;" and he smiled gravely&mdash;"I
      have often thought that my own country would be very much benefited by a
      couple of years existence under an autocrat&mdash;an autocrat like
      Cromwell, for example. A man strong and fierce, intelligent and candid,&mdash;who
      would expose shams and destroy abuses,&mdash;who would have no mercy on
      either religious, social, or political fraud, and who would perform the
      part of the necessary hard broom for sweeping the National house. But,
      unfortunately, we have no such man. You have,&mdash;in your Sergius
      Thord!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The Premier heard this name with unconcealed amazement.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sergius Thord! Why he is a mere fanatic&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pardon me!" interrupted Sir Walter,&mdash;"so was Cromwell!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, my dear sir!" remonstrated the Marquis smilingly,&mdash;"Is it
      possible that you really consider Sergius Thord any sort of an influence
      in this country? If you do, I assure you you are greatly mistaken!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think not," responded Sir Walter quietly; "With every respect for you,
      Marquis, I believe I am not mistaken! Books written by Sergius Thord are
      circulating in their thousands all over the world&mdash;his speeches are
      reported not only here, but in journals which probably you never hear of,
      in far-off countries,&mdash;in short, his propaganda is simply enormous.
      He is a kind of new Rousseau, without,&mdash;so far as I can learn,&mdash;Rousseau's
      private vices. He is a man I much wished to see during my stay here, but I
      have not had the opportunity of finding him out. He is an undoubted
      genius,&mdash;but I need not remind you, Marquis, that a man is never a
      prophet in his own country! The world's 'celebrity' is always eyed with
      more or less suspicion as a strange sort of rogue or vagabond in his own
      native town or village!"
    </p>
    <p>
      At that moment, the King, having concluded a conversation with certain of
      his guests, who were thereupon leaving the Throne-room, approached them.
      He had not spoken a word to the Premier since returning him his
      signet-ring, but now he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Marquis, I was almost forgetting a special request I have to make of
      you!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A request from you is a command, Sir!" replied Lutera with hypocritical
      deference and something of a covert sneer, which did not escape the quick
      observation of Sir Walter Langton.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In certain cases it should be so," returned the King tranquilly; "And in
      this you will probably make it so! I have received a volume of poems by
      one Paul Zouche. His genius appears to me deserving of encouragement. A
      grant of a hundred golden pieces a year will not be too much for his
      hundred best poems. Will you see to this?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The Marquis bowed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have never heard of the man in question," he replied hesitatingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Probably not," returned the King smiling;&mdash;"How often do Premiers
      read poetry, or notice poets? Scarcely ever, if we may credit history! But
      in this case&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will make myself immediately acquainted with Paul Zouche, and inform
      him of your Majesty's gracious intention," the Marquis hastened to say.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is quite possible he may refuse the grant," continued the King;
      "Sometimes&mdash;though seldom&mdash;poets are prouder than Prime
      Ministers!"
    </p>
    <p>
      With a brief nod of dismissal he turned away, inviting Sir Walter Langton
      to accompany him, and there was nothing more for the Marquis to do, save
      to return even as he had come, with two pieces of information puzzling his
      brain,&mdash;one, that the King's 'veto' had stopped a declaration of war,&mdash;unless,&mdash;which
      was a very remote contingency,&mdash;he and his party could persuade the
      people to go against the King,&mdash;the other, that some clever spy, with
      the assistance of a fraudulent imitation of his signet-ring, had become
      aware of the financial interests involved in a private speculation
      depending on the intended war, which included himself, Carl Pérousse, and
      two or three other members of the Ministry. And, out of these two facts
      might possibly arise a whole train of misfortune, ruin and disgrace to
      those concerned.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was considerably past three o'clock in the afternoon when the King,
      retiring to his own private cabinet, desired Sir Roger de Launay to inform
      Prince Humphry that he was now prepared to receive him. Sir Roger
      hesitated a moment before going to fulfil the command. The King looked at
      him with an indulgent smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Things are moving too quickly, you think, Roger?" he queried. "Upon my
      soul, I am beginning to find a new zest in life! I feel some twenty years
      younger since I saw the face of the beautiful Gloria yesterday! We must
      promote her sailor husband, and bring his pearl of the sea to our Court!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was on this very subject, Sir, that Von Glauben wished to see your
      Majesty the first thing this morning," said Sir Roger;&mdash;"But you
      refused him so early an audience. Yet you will remember that yesterday you
      told him you wished for an explanation of his acquaintance with this girl.
      He was ready and prepared to give it, but was prevented,&mdash;not only by
      your refusal to see him,&mdash;but also by the Prince."
    </p>
    <p>
      Drawing up a chair to the open window, the King seated himself
      deliberately, and lit a cigar.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Presumably the Prince knows more than the Professor!" he said calmly; "We
      will hear both, and give Royalty the precedence! Tell Prince Humphry I am
      waiting for him."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Roger withdrew, and in another two or three minutes returned, throwing
      open the door and ushering in the Prince, who entered with a quick step,
      and brief, somewhat haughty salutation. Puffing leisurely at his cigar,
      the King glanced his son up and down smilingly, but said not a word. The
      Prince stood waiting for his father to speak, till at last, growing
      impatient and waiving ceremony, he began.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I came, Sir, to spare Von Glauben your reproaches,&mdash;which he does
      not merit. You accused him yesterday, he tells me, of betraying your
      trust; he has neither betrayed your trust nor mine! I alone am to blame in
      this matter!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "In what matter?" enquired the King quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Prince Humphry coloured deeply, and then grew pale. There was a ray of
      defiance in the light of his fine eyes, but the tumult within his soul
      showed itself only in an added composure of his features.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You wish me to speak plainly, I suppose," he said;&mdash;"though you know
      already what I mean. I repeat,&mdash;I, and I alone, am to blame,&mdash;for&mdash;for
      anything that seemed strange to you yesterday, when you met Von Glauben at
      The Islands."
    </p>
    <p>
      The King's serious face lightened with a gleam of laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing seemed very strange to me, Humphry," he said, "except the one
      fact that I found Von Glauben,&mdash;whom I supposed to be studying
      scientific problems,&mdash;engaged in studying a woman instead! A very
      beautiful woman, too, who ought to be something better than a sailor's
      wife. And I do not understand, as yet, what he has to do with her, unless&mdash;"
      Here he paused and went on more slowly&mdash;"Unless he is, as I suspect,
      acting for you in some way, and trying to tempt the fair creature with the
      prospect of a prince's admiration while the sailor husband is out of the
      way! Remember, I know nothing&mdash;I merely hazard a guess. You are an
      habitué of The Islands;&mdash;though I learned, on enquiry of the
      interesting old gentleman who was good enough to be my host, Réné Ronsard,
      that nobody had ever seen you there. They had only seen your yacht
      constantly cruising about the bay. This struck me as curious, I must
      confess. Some of your men were well known,&mdash;particularly one,&mdash;the
      husband of the pretty girl I saw. Her name, it seems, is Gloria,&mdash;and
      I must admit that it entirely suits her. I can hardly imagine that if you
      have visited The Islands as often as you seem to have done, you can have
      escaped seeing her. She is too beautiful to remain unknown to you&mdash;particularly
      if her husband is, as they tell me, in your service. I asked her to give
      me his name, but she refused it point-blank. I do not wish to accuse you
      of an amour, which you are perhaps quite innocent of&mdash;but certain
      things taken in their conjunction look suspicious,&mdash;and I would
      remind you that honour in princes,&mdash;as in all men,&mdash;should come
      before self-indulgence."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I entirely agree with you, Sir!" said the Prince, composedly; "And in the
      present case honour has been my first thought, as it will be my last.
      Gloria is my wife!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your wife!" The King rose, his tall figure looking taller, his eyes
      sparkling with anger from under their deep-set brows. "Your wife! Are you
      mad, Humphry! You!&mdash;&mdash;the Heir-Apparent to the Throne! You have
      married her!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have!" replied the Prince, and the words now came coursing rapidly from
      his lips in his excitement&mdash;"I love her! I love her with all my heart
      and soul!&mdash;and I have given her the only shield and safeguard love in
      this world can give! I have married her in my own name&mdash;the name of
      our family,&mdash;which neither she nor any of the humble folk out yonder
      have ever heard&mdash;but she is wedded to me as fast as Church and Law
      can make it,&mdash;and there is only one wrong connected with my vows to
      her&mdash;she does not know who I am. I have deceived her there,&mdash;but
      in nothing else. Had I told her of my rank, she would never have married
      me. But now she is mine,&mdash;and for her sake I am willing to resign all
      pretension to the Throne in favour of my brother Rupert. Let it be so, I
      implore you! Let me live my own life of love and liberty in my own way!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Rigid as a statue the King stood,&mdash;his lips were set hard and his
      eyes lowered. Long buried thoughts rose up from the innermost recesses of
      his being, and rushed upon his brain in a deluge of remembrance and
      regret. What!&mdash;after all these years, had the ghost of his first
      love, the little self-slain maiden of his boyhood's dream, risen to avenge
      herself in the life of his son? The strangeness of the comparison between
      himself as he was now, and the eager passionate youth he was then, smote
      him with a sense of sharp pain. Away in those far-off days he had believed
      in love as the chief glory of existence; he had considered it as the poets
      would have us consider it,&mdash;a saving, binding, holding and immortal
      influence, which leads to all pure and holy things, even unto God Himself,
      the Highest and Holiest of all. When he lost that belief, how great was
      his loss!&mdash;when he ceased to experience that pure idealistic emotion,
      how bitter became the monotony of living! Rapidly the stream of memory
      swept over his innermost soul and shook his nerves, and it was only
      through a strong effort of self-repression that at last, lifting up his
      eyes he fixed them on the flushed face of his son, and said in measured
      tones.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This is a very unexpected and very unhappy confession of yours, Humphry!
      You have acted most unwisely!&mdash;you have been disloyal to me, who am
      not only your father, but your King! You have proved yourself unworthy of
      the nation's trust,&mdash;and you have deceived, more cruelly than you
      think, an innocent and too-confiding girl. I shall not dispute the
      legality of your marriage;&mdash;that would not be worth my while. You
      have no doubt taken every step to make it as binding as possible;&mdash;however,
      that is but a trifling matter in your case. You know that such a marriage
      is, and can only be morganatic;&mdash;and as the immediate consequence of
      your amazing folly, a suitable Royal alliance must be arranged for you at
      once. The nuptials can be celebrated with the attainment of your majority
      next year."
    </p>
    <p>
      He spoke coldly and calmly, but his heart was beating with mingled wrath
      and pain, and even while he thus pronounced her doom, the exquisite face
      of Gloria floated before him like the vision of a perfect innocence ruined
      and betrayed. He realised that he possibly had an unusual character to
      reckon with in her,&mdash;and he had lately become fully aware that there
      was as much determination and latent force in the disposition of his son,
      as in the mother who had given him birth. Pale and composed, the young
      Prince heard him in absolute silence, and when he had finished, still
      waited a moment, lest any further word should fall from the lips of his
      parent and Sovereign. Then he spoke in quite as measured, cold and
      tranquil a manner as the King had done.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I need not remind you, Sir, that the days of tyranny are over. You cannot
      force me into bigamy against my will!"
    </p>
    <p>
      His father uttered a quick oath.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bigamy! Who talks of bigamy?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You do, Sir! I have married a beautiful and innocent woman,&mdash;she is
      my lawful wife in the sight of God and man; yet you coolly propose to give
      me a second wife under the 'morganatic' law, which, as I view it, is
      merely a Royal excuse for bigamy! Now I have no wish to excuse myself for
      marrying Gloria,&mdash;I consider she has honoured me far more than I have
      honoured her. She has given me all her youth, her life, her love, her
      beauty and her trust, and whatever I am worth in this world shall be hers
      and hers only. I am quite prepared"&mdash;and he smiled somewhat
      sarcastically,&mdash;"to make it a test case, and appeal to the law of the
      realm. If that law tolerates a crime in princes, which it would punish in
      commoners, then I shall ask the People to judge me!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indeed!" And the King surveyed him with a touch of ironical amusement and
      vague admiration for his audacity. "And suppose the people fail to
      appreciate the romance of the situation?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then I shall resign my nationality;" said the young man coolly; "Because
      a country that legalises a wrong done to the innocent, is not worth
      belonging to! Concerning the Throne,&mdash;as I told you before&mdash;I am
      ready to abandon it at once. I would rather lose all the kingdoms of the
      world than lose Gloria!"
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a pause, during which the King took two or three slow paces up
      and down the room. At last he turned and faced his son; his eyes were
      softer&mdash;his look more kindly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are very much in love just now, Humphry!" he said; "And I do not wish
      to be too hard on you in this matter, for there can be no question as to
      the extraordinary beauty of the girl you call your wife&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The girl who <i>is</i> my wife," interrupted the Prince decisively.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well; so let it be!" said his father calmly; "The girl who <i>is</i>
      your wife&mdash;for the present! I will give you time&mdash;plenty of time&mdash;to
      consider the position reasonably!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have already considered it," he declared.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No doubt! You think you have considered it. But if <i>you</i> do not want
      to meditate any further upon your marriage problem, you must allow me the
      leisure to do so, as one who has seen more of life than you,&mdash;as one
      who takes things philosophically&mdash;and also&mdash;as one who was young&mdash;once;&mdash;who
      loved&mdash;once;&mdash;and who had his own private dreams of happiness&mdash;once!"
      He rested a hand on his son's shoulder, and looked him full and fairly in
      the eyes. "Let me advise you, Humphry, to go abroad! Travel round the
      world for a year!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The Prince was silent,&mdash;but his eyes did not flinch from his father's
      steady gaze. He seemed to be thinking rapidly; but his thoughts were not
      betrayed by any movement or expression that could denote anxiety. He was
      alert, calm, and perfectly self-possessed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have no objection," he said at last; "A year is soon past!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is," agreed the King, with a sense of relief at his ready assent; "But
      by the end of that time&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Things will be precisely as they are now," said the Prince tranquilly;
      "Gloria will still be my wife, and I shall still be her husband!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The King gave a gesture of annoyance.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Whatever the result," he said, "she cannot, and will not be Crown
      Princess!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "She will not envy that destiny in my brother Rupert's wife," said Prince
      Humphry quietly; "Nor shall I envy my brother Rupert!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You talk like a fool, Humphry!" said the King impatiently; "You cannot
      resign your Heir-Apparency to the Throne, without giving a reason;&mdash;and
      so making known your marriage."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is precisely what I wish to do," returned the young man. "I have no
      intention of keeping my marriage secret. I am proud of it! Gloria is mine&mdash;the
      joy of my soul&mdash;the very pulse of my life! Why should I hide my
      heart's light under a cloud?"
    </p>
    <p>
      His voice vibrated with tender feeling,&mdash;his handsome features were
      softened into finer beauty by the passion which invigorated him, and his
      father looking at him, thought for a moment that so might the young gods
      of the fabled Parnassus have appeared in the height of their symbolic
      power and charm. His own eyes grew melancholy, as he studied this vigorous
      incarnation of ardent love and passionate resolve; and a slight sigh
      escaped him unconsciously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You forget!" he said slowly, "you have, up to the present deceived the
      girl. She does not know who you are. When she hears that you have played a
      part,&mdash;that you are no sailor in the service of the Crown Prince, as
      you have apparently represented yourself to be, but the Crown Prince
      himself, what will she say to you? Perhaps she will hate you for the
      deception, as much as she now loves you!"
    </p>
    <p>
      A shadow darkened the young Prince's open countenance, but it soon passed
      away.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She will never hate me!" he said,&mdash;"For when I do tell her the
      truth, it will be when I have resigned all the ridiculous pomp and
      circumstance of my position for her sake&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps she will not let you resign it!" said the King; "She may be as
      unselfish as she is beautiful!"
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a slight, very slight note of derision in his voice, and the
      Prince caught it up at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You wrong yourself, Sir, more than you wrong my wife by any lurking
      misjudgment of her," he said, with singularly masterful and expressive
      dignity. "As her husband, and the guardian of her honour, I also claim her
      obedience. What I desire is her law!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The King laughed a little forcedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Evidently you have found the miracle of the ages, Humphry!" he said; "A
      woman who obeys her master! Well! Let us talk no more of it. You have been
      guilty of an egregious folly,&mdash;but nothing can make your marriage
      otherwise than morganatic. And when the State considers a Royal alliance
      for you advisable, you will be compelled to obey the country's wish,&mdash;or
      else resign the Throne."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall obey the country's wish most decidedly," said the Prince, "unless
      it asks me to commit bigamy,&mdash;as you suggest,&mdash;in which case I
      shall decline! Three or four Royal sinners of this class I know of, who
      for all their pains have not succeeded in winning the attachment of their
      people, either for themselves or their heirs. Their people know what they
      are, well enough, and despise their fraudulent position as heartily as I
      do! I am perfectly convinced that if it were put to the vote of the
      country, no people in the world would wish their future monarch to be a
      bigamist!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "How you stick to a word and a phrase!" exclaimed the King irritably; "The
      morganatic rule does away with the very idea of bigamy!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "How do you prove it, Sir?" queried the Prince. "Bigamy is the act of
      contracting a second marriage while the first partner is alive. It is
      punished severely in commoners;&mdash;why should Royalty escape?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The King began to laugh. This boy was developing 'discursive philosophies'
      such as his own old tutor had abhorred.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Upon my life, I do not know, Humphry!" he declared; "You must ask the
      departed shades of those who made themselves responsible for kingship in
      the first place. Personally, I do not come under the law. I have only
      married once myself!"
    </p>
    <p>
      His son looked full at him;&mdash;and the intensity of that look affected
      and unsteadied his usual calm nerves. But he was not one to shirk an
      unpleasant suggestion.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You would say, Humphry, if your filial respect permitted you, that my one
      marriage has been amplified in various other ways. Perfectly true! When
      women lie down and ask you to walk over them, you do it if you are a man
      and a king! When, on the contrary, women show you that they do not care
      whether you are royal or the reverse, and despise you more than admire
      you, you run after them for all you are worth! At least I do! I always
      have done so. And, to a certain extent, it has been amusing. But the limit
      is reached. I am growing old!" Here he took up the cigar he had thrown
      aside when his son had first startled him by the announcement of his
      marriage, and relighting it, began to smoke peaceably. "I am, as I say,
      growing old. I have never found what is called love. You have&mdash;or
      think you have! Enjoy your dream, Humphry&mdash;but&mdash;take my advice
      and go abroad! See whether travel does not work a change in you or,&mdash;in
      her!" He paused a moment, and while the Prince still regarded him fixedly,
      added; "Will you tell the Queen?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will leave you to tell her, Sir, with your permission;" replied the
      Prince; "I cannot expect her sympathy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Von Glauben, then, is the only person you have trusted with your
      confidence?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Von Glauben was no party to my marriage, Sir. I was married fully three
      months before I told him. He was greatly vexed and troubled,&mdash;but
      when he saw Gloria, he was glad."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Glad!" echoed the King; "For what reason, pray?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am afraid, Sir," said the young man with a smile, "his gladness was but
      a part of his science! He said it was better for a prince to wed a healthy
      and beautiful commoner, than the daughter of a hundred scrofulous kings!"
    </p>
    <p>
      With a movement of intense indignation, the monarch sprang up from the
      chair in which he had just seated himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now, by Heaven!" he exclaimed; "Von Glauben goes too far! He shall suffer
      for this!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why?" queried the Prince calmly; "You know that what he says is perfectly
      true. True? Why, there is scarcely a Royal house in the world save our
      own, without its hereditary curse of disease or insanity. We pay more
      attention to the breeding of horses than the breeding of kings!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The plain candour and veracity of the statement, left no room for denial.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have seen Gloria," went on the Prince; "You know she is the most
      beautiful creature your eyes ever rested upon! Von Glauben told me you
      were stricken dumb, and almost stupefied at sight of her&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Damn Von Glauben!" said the King.
    </p>
    <p>
      His son smiled ever so slightly, but continued.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have made yourself acquainted with her history&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes!" said the King; "That she is a foundling picked up from the sea&mdash;a
      castaway from a wreck!&mdash;no one knows who her father and mother were,
      and yet you, in your raving madness and folly of love, would make her
      Crown Princess and future Queen!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The Prince went on unheedingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She is beautiful&mdash;and the simple method of her bringing up has left
      her unspoilt and innocent. She is ignorant of the world's ways&mdash;because&mdash;"
      and his voice sank to a reverential tenderness&mdash;"God's ways are more
      familiar to her!" He paused, but his father was silent; he therefore went
      on. "She is healthy, strong, simple and true,&mdash;more fit for a throne,
      if such were her destiny, than any daughter of any Royal house I know of.
      Happy the nation that could call such a woman their Queen!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "As I have already told you, Humphry," returned the King, "you are in
      love!&mdash;with the love of a headstrong, passionate boy for a beautiful
      and credulous girl. I do not propose to discuss the subject further. You
      are willing to go abroad, you tell me,&mdash;then make your preparations
      at once. I will select one or two necessary companions for you, and you
      can start when you please. I would let Von Glauben accompany you, but&mdash;for
      the present&mdash;I cannot well spare him. Your intended voyage must be
      made public, and in this way nothing will be known of the manner in which
      you have privately chosen to make a fool of yourself. I will explain the
      situation to the Queen;&mdash;but beyond that I shall say nothing. Let me
      know by to-morrow how soon you can arrange your departure."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Prince bowed composedly, and was about to retire, when the King called
      him back.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You do not ask my pardon, Humphry, for the offence you have committed?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man flushed, and bit his lip.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sir, I cannot ask pardon for what I do not consider is wrong! I have
      married the woman I love; and I intend to be faithful to her. You married
      a woman you did not love&mdash;and the result, according to my views, and
      also according to my experience of my mother and yourself, is more or less
      regrettable. If I have offended you, I sincerely beg your forgiveness, but
      you must first point out the nature of the offence. Surely, it must be
      more gratifying to you to know that I prefer to be a man of honour than a
      common seducer?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The King looked at him, and his own eyes fell under his son's clear candid
      gaze.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Enough! You may go!" he said briefly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The door opened and closed again;&mdash;he was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      The King, left alone, fixed his eyes on the sparkling line of the sea,
      brightly blue, and the flower-bordered terrace in front of him. Life was
      becoming interesting;&mdash;the long burdensome monotony of years had
      changed into a variety of contrasting scenes and colours,&mdash;and in
      taking up the problem of human life as lived by others, more than as lived
      by himself, he had entered on a new path, untrodden by conventionalities,
      and leading, he knew not whither. But, having begun to walk in it, he was
      determined to go on&mdash;and to use each new experience as a guide for
      the rest of his actions. His son's marriage with a commoner&mdash;one who
      indeed was not only a commoner but a foundling&mdash;might after all lead
      to good, if properly taken in hand,&mdash;and he resolved not to make the
      worst of it, but rather to let things take their own natural course.
    </p>
    <p>
      "For love," he said to himself somewhat bitterly, "in nine cases out of
      ten ends in satiety,&mdash;marriage, in separation by mutual consent! Let
      the boy travel for a year, and forget, if he can, the fair face which
      captivates him,&mdash;for it is a fair face,&mdash;and more than that,&mdash;I
      honestly believe it is the reflex of a fair soul!"
    </p>
    <p>
      His eyes grew dreamy and absorbed; away on the horizon a little white
      cloud, shaped like the outspread wings of a dove, hovered over the sea
      just where The Islands lay.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes! Let him see new scenes&mdash;strange lands, and varying customs; let
      him hear modern opinions of life, instead of reading the philosophies of
      Aurelius and Epictetus, and the poetry written ages ago by the dead wild
      souls of the past;&mdash;and so he will forget&mdash;and all will be well!
      While for Gloria herself,&mdash;and the old revolutionist Ronsard&mdash;we
      shall doubtless find ways and means of consolation for them both!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus he mused,&mdash;yet in the very midst of his thoughts the echoing
      memory of a golden voice, round and rich with delight and triumph rang in
      his ears:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  "My King crown'd me!
    And I and he
  Are one till the world shall cease to be!"

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVI. &mdash; THE PROFESSOR ADVISES
    </h2>
    <p>
      "I have discovered the secret of successful living, Professor," said the
      King, a couple of hours later as, walking in one of the many thickly
      wooded alleys of the palace grounds, he greeted Von Glauben, who had been
      told to meet him there, and who had been waiting the Royal approach with
      some little trepidation,&mdash;"It is this,&mdash;to draw a straight line
      of conduct, and walk in it, regardless of other people's crooked curves!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The Professor looked at him, and saw nothing but kindliness expressed in
      his eyes and smile,&mdash;therefore, taking courage he replied without
      embarrassment,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Truly, Sir, if a man is brave enough to do this, he may conquer
      everything but death, and even face this last enemy without much alarm."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I agree with you!" replied the monarch; "And Humphry's line has certainly
      been straight enough, taken from the point of his own perspective! Do you
      not think so?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Von Glauben hesitated a moment&mdash;then spoke out boldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sir, as you now know all, I will frankly assure you that I think his
      Royal Highness has behaved honourably, and as a true man! Society pardons
      a prince for seducing innocence&mdash;but whether it will pardon him for
      marrying it, is quite another question! And that is why I repeat, he has
      behaved well. Though when he first told me he was married, I suffered a
      not-to-be-explained misery and horror; 'For,' said he&mdash;'I have
      married an angel!' Which naturally I thought (deducting a certain quantity
      of the enthusiasm of youth for the statement) meant that he had married a
      bouncing housemaid with large hands and feet. 'That is well,' I told him&mdash;'For
      divorce is now made easy in this country, and you can easily return the
      celestial creature to her native element!' At which I resigned myself to
      hear some oaths, for violent expletives are always refreshing to the
      masculine brain-matter. But his Royal Highness maintained the good
      breeding which always distinguishes him, and merely proceeded with his
      strange confession of romance,&mdash;which, as you, Sir, are now happily
      aware of it, I need not recapitulate. Your knowledge of the matter has
      lifted an enormous burden from my mind; Ach! Enormous!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He gave a deep breath, and drew himself up to his full height&mdash;squared
      his shoulders, and then, as it were stood firm, as though waiting attack.
    </p>
    <p>
      The King laughed good-naturedly, and took him by the arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tell me all you know, Von Glauben!" he said; "I am acquainted with the
      gist and upshot of the matter,&mdash;namely, Humphry's marriage; but I am
      wholly ignorant of the details."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is little to tell, Sir," said Von Glauben;&mdash;"Of the Prince's
      constant journeyings to The Islands we were all aware long ago; but the
      cause of those little voyages was not so apparent. To avoid the suspicion
      with which a Royal visitor would be viewed, the Prince, it appears,
      assumed to be merely one of the junior officers on his own yacht,&mdash;and
      under this disguise became known and much liked by the Islanders
      generally. He fell in love at first sight with the beautiful girl your
      Majesty saw yesterday&mdash;Gloria; 'Glory-of-the-Sea'&mdash;as I
      sometimes call her, and they were married by the old parish priest in the
      little church among the rocks&mdash;the very church where, as her adopted
      father, Ronsard, tells me, he heard the choristers singing a 'Gloria in
      Excelsis' on the day he found her cast up on the shore."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well!" said the King, seeing that he paused; "And is the marriage legal,
      think you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perfectly so, Sir!" replied Von Glauben; "Registered by law, as well as
      sanctified by church. The Prince tells me he married her in his own name,&mdash;but
      no one,&mdash;not even the poor little priest who married them,&mdash;knew
      the surname of your Majesty's distinguished house, and I believe,&mdash;nay
      I am sure&mdash;" here he heaved an unconscious sigh, "it will bring a
      tragedy to the girl when she knows the true rank and title of her
      husband!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "How came <i>you</i> to make her acquaintance? Tell me everything!&mdash;you
      know I will not misjudge you!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indeed, Sir, I hope you will not!" returned the Professor earnestly;&mdash;"For
      there was never a man more hopelessly involved than myself in the net
      prepared for me by this romantic lover, who has the honour to be your son.
      In the first place, directly I heard this confession of marriage, I was
      for telling you at once; but as he had bound me by my word of honour
      before he began the story, to keep his confidence sacred, I was unable to
      disburden myself of it. He said he wanted to secure me as a friend for his
      wife. 'That,' said I firmly, 'I will never be! For there will be
      difficulty when all is known; and if it comes to a struggle between a
      pretty fishwife and the good of a king&mdash;ach!&mdash;mein Gott!&mdash;I
      am not for the fishwife!'"
    </p>
    <p>
      The King smiled; and Von Glauben went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, he assured me she was not a fishwife. I said 'What is she then?' 'I
      tell you,' he replied, 'she is an angel! You will come and see her; you
      will pass as an old friend of her sailor husband; and when you have seen
      her you will understand!' I was angry, and said I would not go with him;
      but afterwards I thought perhaps it would be best if I did, as I might be
      able to advise him to some wise course. So I accompanied him one afternoon
      in the past autumn to The Islands (he was married last summer) and saw the
      girl,&mdash;the 'Glory-of-the-Sea.' And I must confess to your Majesty, my
      heart went down before her beauty and innocence in absolute worship! And
      if you were to kill me for it, I cannot help it&mdash;I am now as devoted
      to her service as I am to yours!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good!" said the King gently;&mdash;"Then you must help me to console her
      in Humphry's absence!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Professor Von Glauben's eyes opened widely, with a vague look of alarm.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In his absence, Sir?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes! I am sending him abroad. He is quite willing to go, he tells me. His
      departure will make all things perfectly easy for us. The girl must remain
      in her present ignorance as to the position of the man she has really
      married. The sailor she supposes him to be will accompany the Prince on
      his yacht,&mdash;and it must be arranged that he never returns! She is
      young, and will easily be consoled!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Von Glauben was silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>You</i> will not betray the Prince's identity with her lover," went on
      the King, "and no one else knows it. In fact, you will be the very person
      best qualified to tell her of his departure, and&mdash;in due time, of his
      fictitious death!"
    </p>
    <p>
      They were walking slowly under the heavy shadow of crossed ilex boughs,&mdash;and
      Von Glauben came to a dead halt.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sir," he said, in rather unsteady accents; "With every respect for your
      Majesty, I must altogether decline the task of breaking a pure heart, and
      ruining a young life! Moreover, if your Majesty, after all your recent
      experiences,"&mdash;and he laid great emphasis on these last words,
      "thinks there is any ultimate good to be obtained by keeping up a lie, and
      practising a fraud, the lessons we have learned in these latter days are
      wholly unavailing! You began this conversation with me by speaking of a
      straight line of conduct, which should avoid other people's crooked
      curves. Is this your Majesty's idea of a straight line?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He spoke with unguarded vehemence, but the King was not offended. On the
      contrary, he looked whimsically interested and amused.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear Von Glauben, you are not usually so inconsistent! Humphry himself
      has kept up a lie, and practised a fraud on the girl&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Only for a time!" interrupted the Professor hastily.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, we all do it 'only for a time.' Everything&mdash;life itself&mdash;is
      'only for a time!' You know as well as I do that this absurd marriage can
      never be acknowledged. I explained as much to Humphry; I told him he could
      guard himself by the morganatic law, provided he would consent to a Royal
      alliance immediately&mdash;but the young fool swore it would be bigamy,
      and took himself off in a huff."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He was right! It would be bigamy;&mdash;it <i>is</i> bigamy!", said the
      Professor; "Call it by what name you like in Court parlance, the act of
      having two wives is forbidden in this country. The wisest men have come to
      the conclusion that one wife is enough!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Humphry's ideas being so absolutely childish," went on the King, "it is
      necessary for him to expand them somewhat. That is why I shall send him
      abroad. You have a strong flavour of romance in your Teutonic composition,
      Von Glauben,&mdash;and I can quite sympathise with your admiration for the
      'Glory-of-the-Sea' as you call her. From a man's point of view, I admire
      her myself. But I know nothing of her moral or mental qualities; though
      from her flat refusal to give me her husband's name yesterday, I judge her
      as wilful,&mdash;but most pretty women are that. And as for my line of
      conduct, it will, I assure you, be perfectly 'straight,'&mdash;in the
      direction of my duty as a King,&mdash;apart altogether from sentimental
      considerations! And in this, as in other things,&mdash;" he paused and
      emphasised his words&mdash;"I rely on your honour and faithful service!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The Professor made no reply. He was, thinking deeply. With a kind of grim
      scorn, he pointed out to himself that his imagination was held captive by
      the mental image of a woman, whose eyes had expressed trust in him; and
      almost as tenderly as the lover in Tennyson's 'Maud' he could have said
      that he 'would die, To save from some slight shame one simple girl.'
      Presently he braced himself up, and confronted his Royal master.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sir," he said very quietly, yet with perfect frankness; "Your Majesty
      must have the goodness to pardon me if I say you must not rely upon me at
      all in this matter! I will promise nothing, except to be true to myself
      and my own sense of justice. I have given up my own country for
      conscience' sake&mdash;I can easily give up another which is not my own,
      for the same reason. In the matter of this marriage or 'mésalliance' as
      the worldly would call it,&mdash;I have nothing whatever to do. While the
      Prince asked me to keep his secret, I kept it. Now that he has confided it
      to your Majesty, I am relieved and satisfied; and shall not in any way, by
      word or suggestion, interfere with your Majesty's intentions. But, at the
      same time, I shall not assist them! For as regards the trusting girl who
      has been persuaded that she has won a great love and complete happiness
      for all her life,&mdash;I have sworn to be her friend;&mdash;and I must
      respectfully decline to be a party to any further deception in her case.
      Knowing what I know of her character, which is a pure and grand one, I
      think it would be far better to tell her the whole truth, and let her be
      the arbiter of her own destiny. She will decide well and truly, I am
      sure!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He ceased; the King was silent. Von Glauben studied his face attentively.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are a thinker, Sir,&mdash;a student and a philosopher. You are not
      one of those kings who treat their kingship as a license for the free
      exercise of intolerant humours and vicious practices. Were you no monarch
      at all, you would still be a sane and thoughtful man. Take my humble
      advice, Sir&mdash;for once put the unspoilt nature of a pure woman to the
      test, and find out what a grand creature God intended woman to be, in her
      pristine simplicity and virtue! Send for Gloria to this Court;&mdash;tell
      her the truth!&mdash;and await the result with confidence!"
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a pause. The King walked slowly up and down; at last he spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You may be right! I do not say you are wrong. I will consider your
      suggestion. Certainly it would be the straightest course. But first a
      complete explanation is due to the Queen. She must know all,&mdash;and if
      her interest can be awakened by such a triviality as her son's love-affair&mdash;"
      and he smiled somewhat bitterly,&mdash;"perhaps she may agree to your plan
      as the best way out of the difficulty. In any case"&mdash;here he extended
      his hand which the Professor deferentially bowed over&mdash;"I respect
      your honesty and plain speaking, Professor! I have reason to approve
      highly of sincerity,&mdash;wherever and however I find it,&mdash;at the
      present crisis of affairs. For the moment, I will only ask you to be on
      your guard with Humphry;&mdash;and say as little as possible to him on the
      subject of his marriage or intended departure from this country. Keep
      everything as quiet as may be;&mdash;till&mdash;till we find a clear and
      satisfactory course to follow, which shall inflict as little pain as
      possible on all concerned. And now, a word with you on other matters."
    </p>
    <p>
      They walked on side by side, through the garden walks and ways, conversing
      earnestly,&mdash;and by and by penetrating into the deeper recesses of the
      outlying woodlands, were soon hidden among the crossing and recrossing of
      the trees. Had they kept to the open ground, from whence the wide expanse
      of the sea could be viewed from end to end, their discussions might
      perhaps have been interrupted, and themselves somewhat startled,&mdash;for
      they would have seen Prince Humphry's yacht, with every inch of canvas
      stretched to the utmost, flying rapidly before the wind like a wild white
      bird, winging its swift, straight way to the west where the sun shot down
      Apollo-like shafts of gold on the gleaming purple coast-line of The
      Islands.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVII. &mdash; AN "HONOURABLE" STATESMAN
    </h2>
    <p>
      It is not easy to trace the causes why it so often happens that
      semi-educated, and more or less shallow men rise suddenly to a height of
      brilliant power and influence in the working of a country's policy.
      Sometimes it is wealth that brings them to the front; sometimes the strong
      support secretly given to them by others in the background, who have their
      own motives to serve, and who require a public representative; but more
      often still it is sheer unscrupulousness,&mdash;or what may be described
      as 'walking over' all humane and honest considerations,&mdash;that places
      them in triumph at the helm of affairs. To rise from a statesman to be a
      Secretary of State augurs a certain amount of brain, though not
      necessarily of the highest quality; while it certainly betokens a good
      deal of dash and impudence. Carl Pérousse, one of the most prominent among
      the political notabilities of Europe, had begun his career by small
      peddling transactions in iron and timber manufactures; he came of a very
      plebeian stock, and had received only a desultory sort of education,
      picked up here and there in cheap provincial schools. But he had a
      restless, domineering spirit of ambition. Ashamed of his plebeian origin,
      and embittered from his earliest years by a sense of grudge against those
      who moved in the highest and most influential circles of the time, the
      idea was always in his mind that he would one day make himself an
      authority over the very persons, who, in the rough and tumble working-days
      of his younger manhood, would not so much as cast him a word or a look. He
      knew that the first thing necessary to attain for this purpose was money;
      and he had, by steady and constant plod, managed to enlarge and expand all
      his business concerns into various, important companies, which he set
      afloat in all quarters of the world,&mdash;with the satisfactory result
      that by the time his years had run well into the forties, he was one of
      the wealthiest men in the country. He had from the first taken every
      opportunity to insinuate himself into politics; and in exact proportion to
      the money he made, so was his success in acquiring such coveted positions
      in life as brought with them the masterful control of various conflicting
      aims and interests. His individual influence had extended by leaps and
      bounds till he had become only secondary in importance to the Prime
      Minister himself; and he possessed a conveniently elastic conscience,
      which could be stretched at will to suit any party or any set of
      principles. In personal appearance he was not prepossessing. Nature had
      branded him in her own special way 'Trickster,' for those who cared to
      search for her trademark. He was tall and thin, with a narrow head and a
      deeply-lined, clean-shaven countenance, the cold immovability of which was
      sometimes broken up by an unpleasant smile, that merely widened the pale
      set lips without softening them, and disclosed a crooked row of
      smoke-coloured teeth, much decayed. He had small eyes, furtively hidden
      under a somewhat restricted frontal development,&mdash;his brows were
      narrow,&mdash;his forehead ignoble and retreating. But despite a general
      badness, or what may be called a 'smirchiness' of feature, he had learned
      to assume an air of superiority, which by its sheer audacity prevented a
      casual observer from setting him down as the vulgarian he undoubtedly was;
      and his amazing pluck, boldness and originality in devising ways and means
      of smothering popular discontent under various 'shows' of apparent public
      prosperity, was immensely useful to all such 'statesmen,' whose
      statesmanship consisted in making as much money as possible for themselves
      out of the pockets of their credulous countrymen. He was seldom disturbed
      by opposing influences; and even now when he had just returned from the
      palace with the full knowledge that the King was absolutely resolved on
      vetoing certain propositions he had set down in council for the somewhat
      arbitrary treatment of a certain half-tributary power which had latterly
      turned rebellious, he was more amused than irritated.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I suppose his Majesty wants to distinguish himself by a melodramatic <i>coup
      d'état</i>" he said, leaning easily back in his chair, and studying the
      tips of his carefully pared and polished finger-nails;&mdash;"Poor fool! I
      don't blame him for trying to do something more than walk about his palace
      in different costumes at stated intervals,&mdash;but he will find his
      'veto' out of date. We shall put it to the country;&mdash;and I think I
      can answer for that!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He smiled, as one who knows where and how to secure a triumph, and his
      equanimity was not disturbed in the least by the unexpected arrival of the
      Premier, who was just then announced, and who, coming in his turn from the
      King's diplomatic reception, had taken the opportunity to call and see his
      colleague on his way home.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You seem fatigued, Marquis!" he said, as, rising to receive his
      distinguished guest, he placed a chair for him opposite his own. "Was his
      Majesty's conversazione more tedious than usual?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Lutera looked at him with a dubious air.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No!&mdash;it was brief enough so far as I was immediately concerned," he
      replied;&mdash;"I do not suppose I stayed more than twenty minutes in the
      Throne-room altogether. I understand you have been told that our proposed
      negotiations are to be vetoed?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Pérousse smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have been told&mdash;yes!&mdash;but I have been told many things which
      I do not believe! The King certainly has the right of veto; but he dare
      not exercise it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dare not?" echoed the Marquis&mdash;"From his present unconstitutional
      attitude it seems to me he dare do anything!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I tell you he dare not!" repeated Pérousse quietly;&mdash;"Unless he
      wishes to lose the Throne. I daresay if it came to that, we should get on
      quite as well&mdash;if not better&mdash;with a Republic!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Lutera looked at him with an amazed and reluctant admiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>You</i> talk of a Republic? You,&mdash;who are for ever making the
      most loyal speeches in favour of the monarchy?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why not?" queried Pérousse lightly;&mdash;"If the monarchy does not do as
      it is told, whip it like a naughty child and send it to bed. That has been
      easily arranged before now in history!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The Marquis sat silent,&mdash;thinking, or rather brooding heavily. Should
      he, or should he not unburden himself of certain fears that oppressed his
      mind? He cleared his throat of a troublesome huskiness and began,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "If the purely business transactions in which you are engaged&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you also," put in Pérousse placidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Premier shifted his position uneasily and went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I say, if the purely business transactions of this affair were publicly
      known&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "As well expect Cabinet secrets to be posted on a hoarding in the open
      thoroughfare!" said Pérousse. "What afflicts you with these sudden pangs
      of distrust at your position? You have taken care to provide for all your
      own people! What more can you desire?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Lutera hesitated; then he said slowly:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think there is only one thing for me to do,&mdash;and that is to send
      in my resignation at once!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Carl Pérousse raised himself a little out of his chair, and opened his
      narrow eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Send in your resignation!" he echoed; "On what grounds? Do me the
      kindness to remember, Marquis, that I am not yet quite ready to take your
      place!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He smiled his disagreeable smile,&mdash;and the Marquis began to feel
      irritated.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do not be too sure that you will ever have it to take," he said with some
      acerbity; "If the King should by any means come to know of your financial
      deal&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You seem to be very suddenly afraid of the King!" interrupted Pérousse;
      "Or else strange touches of those catch-word ideals 'Loyalty' and
      'Patriotism' are troubling your mind! You speak of <i>my</i> financial
      deal,&mdash;is not yours as important? Review the position;&mdash;it is
      simply this;&mdash;for years and years the Ministry have been speculating
      in office matters,&mdash;it is no new thing. Sometimes they have lost, and
      sometimes they have won; their losses have been replaced by the imposition
      of taxes on the people,&mdash;their gains they have very wisely said
      nothing about. In these latter days, however, the loss has been
      considerably more than the gain. 'Patriotism,' as stocks, has gone down.
      'Honour' will not pay the piper. We cannot increase taxation just at
      present; but by a war, we can clear out some of the useless population,
      and invest in contracts for supplies. The mob love fighting,&mdash;and
      every small victory won, can be celebrated in beer and illuminations, to
      expand what is called 'the heart of the People.' It is a great 'heart,'
      and always leaps to strong drink,&mdash;which is cheap enough, being so
      largely adulterated. The country we propose to subdue is rich,&mdash;and
      both you and I have large investments of land there. With the success
      which our arms are sure to obtain, we shall fill not only the State
      coffers (which have been somewhat emptied by our predecessors'
      peculations), but our own coffers as well. The King 'vetoes' the war; then
      let us hear what the People say! Of course we must work them up first; and
      then get their verdict while they are red-hot with patriotic excitement.
      The Press, ordered by Jost, can manage that! Put it to the country;
      (through Jost);&mdash;but do not talk of resigning when we are on the
      brink of success! <i>I</i> will carry this thing through, despite the
      King's 'veto'!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wait!" said the Marquis, drawing his chair closer to Pérousse, and
      speaking in a low uneasy tone; "You do not know all! There is some secret
      agency at work against us; and, among other things, I fear that a foreign
      spy has been inadvertently allowed to learn the mainspring of our
      principal moves. Listen, and judge for yourself!"
    </p>
    <p>
      And he related the story of David Jost's midnight experience, carefully
      emphasising every point connected with his own signet-ring. As he
      proceeded with the narration, Pérousse's face grew livid,&mdash;once or
      twice he clenched his hand nervously, but he said nothing till he had
      heard all.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your ring, you say, had never left the King's possession?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "So the King himself assured me, this very afternoon."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then someone must have passed off an imitation signet on David Jost,"
      continued Pérousse meditatively. "What name did the spy give?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pasquin Leroy."
    </p>
    <p>
      Carl Pérousse opened a small memorandum book, and carefully wrote the name
      down within it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Whatever David Jost has said, David Jost alone is answerable for!" he
      then said calmly&mdash;"A Jew may be called a liar with impunity, and
      whatever a Jew has asserted can be flatly denied. Remember, he is in our
      pay!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I doubt if he will consent to be made the scapegoat in this affair," said
      Lutera; "Unless we can make it exceptionally to his advantage;&mdash;he
      has the press at his command."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Give him a title!" returned Pérousse contemptuously; "These Jew press-men
      love nothing better!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The Marquis smiled somewhat sardonically.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Jost, with a patent of nobility would cut rather an extraordinary
      figure!" he said; "Still he would probably make good use of it,&mdash;especially
      if he were to start a newspaper in London! They would accept him as a
      great man there!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Pérousse gave a careless nod; his thoughts were otherwise occupied.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This Pasquin Leroy has gone to Moscow?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "According to his own words, he was leaving this morning."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I daresay that statement is a blind. I should not at all wonder if he is
      still in the city. I will get an exact description of him from Jost, and
      set Bernhoff on his track."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do not forget," said the Marquis impressively, "that he told Jost in
      apparently the most friendly and well-meaning manner possible, that the
      King had discovered the whole plan of our financial campaign. He even
      reported <i>me</i> as being ready to resign in consequence&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Which apparently you are!" interpolated Pérousse with some sarcasm.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I certainly have my resignation in prospect," returned Lutera coldly&mdash;"And,
      so far, this mysterious spy has seemingly probed my thoughts. If he is as
      correct in his report concerning the King, it is impossible to say what
      may be the consequence."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, what can the King do?" demanded Pérousse impatiently, and with scorn
      for the vacillating humour of his companion; "Granted that he knew
      everything from the beginning&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Including your large land purchases and contract concessions in the very
      country you propose war with," put in the Marquis,&mdash;"Say that he knew
      you had resolved on war, and had already started a company for the
      fabrication of the guns and other armaments, out of which you get the
      principal pickings&mdash;what then?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What then?" echoed Pérousse defiantly&mdash;"Why nothing! The King is as
      powerless as a target in a field, set up for arrows to be aimed at! He
      dare not divulge a State secret; he has no privilege of interference with
      politics; all he can do is to 'lead' fashionable society&mdash;a poor
      business at best&mdash;and at present his lead is not particularly
      apparent. The King must do as We command!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He rose and paced up and down with agitated steps.
    </p>
    <p>
      "To-day, when he told me he had resolved to 'veto' my propositions, I
      accepted his information without any manifestation of surprise. I merely
      said it would have to be stated in the Senate, and that reasons would have
      to be given. He agreed, and said that he himself would proclaim those
      reasons. I told him it was impossible!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And what was his reply?" asked the Marquis.
    </p>
    <p>
      "His reply was as absurd as his avowed intention. 'Hitherto it has been
      impossible,' he said; 'But in Our reign we shall make it possible!' He
      declined any further conversation with me, referring me to you and our
      chief colleagues in the Cabinet."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well! I pay no more attention to a King's sudden caprice than I do to the
      veering of the wind! He will alter his mind in a few days, when the
      exigency of the matters in hand becomes apparent to him. In the same way,
      he will revoke his decision about that grant of land to the Jesuits. He
      must let them have their way."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What benefit do we get by favouring the Jesuits?" asked Lutera.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Jost gets a thousand a year for putting flattering notices of the
      schools, processions, festivals and such nonsense in his various
      newspapers; and our party secures the political support of the Vatican in
      Europe,&mdash;which just now is very necessary. The Pope must give his
      Christian benediction not only to our Educational system, but also to the
      war!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then the King has set himself in our way already, even in this matter?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He has! Quite unaccountably and very foolishly. But we shall persuade him
      still to be of our opinion. The ass that will not walk must be beaten till
      he gallops! I have no anxiety whatever on any point; even the advent of
      Jost's spy, with an imitation of your signet on his finger appears to me
      quite melodramatic, and only helps to make the general situation more
      interesting,&mdash;to me at least;&mdash;I am only sorry to see that you
      allow yourself to be so much concerned over these trifles!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have my family to think of," said the Marquis slowly; "My reputation as
      a statesman, and my honour as a minister are both at stake." Pérousse
      smiled oddly, but said nothing. "If in any way my name became a subject of
      popular animadversion, it would entirely ruin the position I believe I
      have attained in history. I have always wished,&mdash;" and there was a
      tinge of pathos in his voice&mdash;"my descendants to hold a certain pride
      in my career!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Pérousse looked at him with grim amusement.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is a curious and unpleasant fact that the 'descendants' of these days
      do not care a button for their ancestors," he said; "They generally try to
      forget them as fast as possible. What do the descendants of Robespierre,
      (if there are any), care about him? The descendants of Wellington? The
      descendants of Beethoven or Lord Byron? Among the many numerous advantages
      attending the world-wide fame of Shakespeare is that he has left no
      descendants. If he had, his memory would have been more vulgarised by <i>them,</i>
      than by any Yankee kicker at his grave! One of the most remarkable
      features of this progressive age is the cheerful ease with which sons
      forget they ever had fathers! I am afraid, Marquis, you are not likely to
      escape the common doom!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Lutera rose slowly, and prepared to take his departure.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall call a Cabinet Council for Monday," he said; "This is Friday. You
      will find it convenient to attend?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Pérousse, rising at the same time, assented smilingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will see things in a better and clearer light by then," he said.
      "Rely on me! I have not involved you thus far with any intention of
      bringing you to loss or disaster. Whatever befalls you in this affair must
      equally befall me; we are both in the same boat. We must carry things
      through with a firm hand, and show no hesitation. As for the King, his
      business is to be a Dummy; and as Dummy he must remain."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lutera made no reply. They shook hands,&mdash;not over cordially,&mdash;and
      parted; and as soon as Pérousse heard the wheels of the Premier's carriage
      grinding away from his outer gate, he applied himself vigorously to the
      handle of one of the numerous telephone wires fitted up near his desk, and
      after getting into communication with the quarter he desired, requested
      General Bernhoff, Chief of the Police, to attend upon him instantly.
      Bernhoff's headquarters were close by, so that he had but to wait barely a
      quarter of an hour before that personage,&mdash;the same who had before
      been summoned to the presence of the King,&mdash;appeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      To him Pérousse handed a slip of paper, on which he had written the words
      'Pasquin Leroy.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you know that name?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      General Bernhoff looked at it attentively. Only the keenest and closest
      observer could have possibly detected the slight flicker of a smile under
      the stiff waxed points of his military moustache, as he read it. He
      returned it carefully folded.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I fancy I have heard it!" he said cautiously; "In any case, I shall
      remember it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good! There is a man of that name in this city; trace him if you can!
      Take this note to Mr. David Jost"&mdash;and while he spoke he hastily
      scrawled a few lines and addressed them&mdash;"and he will give you an
      exact personal description of him. He is reported to have left for Moscow,&mdash;but
      I discredit that statement. He is a foreign spy, engaged, we believe, in
      the work of taking plans of our military defences,&mdash;he must be
      arrested, and dealt with rigorously at once. You understand?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perfectly," replied Bernhoff, accepting the note handed to him; "If he is
      to be discovered, I shall not fail to discover him!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And when you think you are on the track, let me have information at
      once," went on Pérousse; "But be well on your guard, and let no one learn
      the object of your pursuit. Keep your own counsel!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I always do!" returned Bernhoff bluntly. "If I did not there might be
      trouble!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Pérousse looked at him sharply, but seeing the wooden-like impassiveness
      of his countenance, forced a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There might indeed!" he said; "Your tact and discretion, General, do much
      to keep the city quiet. But this affair of Pasquin Leroy is a private
      matter."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Distinctly so!" agreed Bernhoff quietly; "I hold the position entirely!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He shortly afterwards withdrew, and Carl Pérousse, satisfied that he had
      at any rate taken precautions to make known the existence of a spy in the
      city, if not to secure his arrest, turned to the crowding business on his
      hands with a sense of ease and refreshment. He might not have felt quite
      so self-assured and complacent, had he seen the worthy Bernhoff smiling
      broadly to himself as he strolled along the street, with the air of one
      enjoying a joke, the while he murmured,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pasquin Leroy,&mdash;engaged in taking plans of the military defences&mdash;is
      he? Ah!&mdash;a very dangerous amusement to indulge in! Engaged in taking
      plans!&mdash;Ah!&mdash;Yes!&mdash;Very good,&mdash;very good; excellent!
      Do I know the name? Yes! I fancy I might have heard it! Oh, yes, very good
      indeed&mdash;excellent! And this spy is probably still in the city? Yes!&mdash;Probably!
      Yes&mdash;I should imagine it quite likely!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Still smiling, and apparently in the best of humours with himself and the
      world at large, the General continued his easy stroll by the sea-fronted
      ways of the city, along the many picturesque terraces, and up flights of
      marble steps built somewhat in the fashion of the prettiest corners of
      Monaco, till he reached the chief promenade and resort of fashion, which
      being a broad avenue running immediately under and in front of the King's
      palace facing the sea, was in the late sunshine of the afternoon crowded
      with carriages and pedestrians. Here he took his place with the rest,
      saluting a fellow officer here, or a friend there,&mdash;and stood
      bareheaded with the rest of the crowd, when a light gracefully-shaped
      landau, drawn by four greys, and escorted by postillions in the Royal
      liveries, passed like a triumphal car, enshrining the cold, changeless and
      statuesque beauty of the Queen, upon whom the public were never weary of
      gazing. She was a curiosity to them&mdash;a living miracle in her
      unwithering loveliness; for, apparently unmoved by emotion herself, she
      roused all sorts of emotions in others. Bernhoff had seen her a thousand
      times, but never without a sense of new dazzlement.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Always the same Sphinx!" he thought now, with a slight frown shading the
      bluff good-nature of his usual expression; "She is a woman who will face
      Death as she faces Time,&mdash;with that cold smile of hers which
      expresses nothing but scorn of all life's little business!"

    <p>
      He proceeded meditatively on his way to the palace itself, where, on
      demand, he was at once admitted to the private apartments of the King.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVIII. &mdash; ROYAL LOVERS
    </h2>
    <p>
      Silver-white glamour of the moon, and velvet darkness of deep branching
      foliage held the quiet breadth of The Islands between them. Low on the
      shore the fantastic shapes of one or two tall cliffs were outlined black
      on the fine sparkling sand,&mdash;tiny waves rose from the bosom of the
      calm sea, and cuddling together in baby ripples made bubbles of their
      crests, and broke here and there among the pebbles with low gurgles of
      laughter, and in the warm silence of the southern night the nightingales
      began to tune up their delicate fluty voices with delicious tremors and
      pauses in the trying of their song. The under-scent of hidden violets
      among moss flowed potently upon the quiet air, mingled with strong
      pine-odours and the salt breath of the gently heaving sea,&mdash;and all
      the land seemed as lonely and as fair as the fabled Eden might have been,
      when the first two human mated creatures knew it as their own. To every
      soul that loves for the first time, the vision of that Lost Paradise is
      granted; to every man and woman who know and feel the truth of the divine
      passion is vouchsafed a flashing gleam of glory from that Heaven which
      gives them to each other. For the voluptuary&mdash;for the animal man,&mdash;who
      like his four-footed kindred is only conscious of instinctive desire, this
      pure expansion of the heart and ennobling of the thought is as a sealed
      book,&mdash;a never-to-be-divulged mystery of joy, which, because he
      cannot experience it, he is unable to believe in. It is a glory-cloud in
      which the privileged ones are 'caught up and received out of sight.' It
      transfuses the roughest elements into immortal influences,&mdash;it
      colours the earth with fairer hues, and fills the days with beauty; every
      hour is a gem of sweet thought set in the dreaming soul, and the lover, at
      certain times of rapt ecstasy, would smile incredulously were he told that
      anyone living could be unhappy. For love goes back to the beginning of
      things,&mdash;to the time when the world was new. It has its birth in that
      primeval light when 'the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of
      God shouted for joy.' If it is real, deep, passionate and disinterested
      love, it sees no difficulties and knows no disillusions. It is a
      sufficient assurance of God to make life beautiful. But in these days of
      the eld-time of nations, when all things are being mixed and prepared for
      casting into a new mould of world-formation, where we and our
      civilizations are not, and shall not be,&mdash;any more than the Egyptian
      Rameses is part of us now,&mdash;love in its pristine purity, faith and
      simplicity, is rare. Very little romance is left to hallow it; and it is
      doubtful whether the white moon, swinging like a silver lamp in heaven
      above the peaceful Islands, shed her glory anywhere on any such lovers in
      the world, as the two who on this fair night of the southern springtime,
      with arms entwined round each other, moved slowly up and down on the
      velvet greensward outside Ronsard's cottage,&mdash;Gloria and her 'sailor'
      husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gloria was happy,&mdash;and her happiness made her doubly beautiful. Clad
      in her usual attire of white homespun, with her rich hair falling unbound
      over her shoulders in girl-fashion, and just kept back by a band of white
      coral, she looked like a young goddess of the sea; her lustrous, starlike
      eyes gazed up into the tender responsive ones of the handsome stripling
      she had so trustfully wedded, and not a shadow of doubt or fear darkened
      the heaven of her confidence. She did not know how beautiful she was,&mdash;she
      did not realise that her body was like one of the unfettered, graceful and
      perfectly-proportioned figures of women left to our wondering reverence by
      the Greek sculptors,&mdash;she had never thought about herself at all, not
      even to compare her fair brilliancy of skin with the bronzed,
      weather-beaten faces of the fisher-folk among whom she dwelt. Resting her
      delicate classic head against the encircling arm of her lover and lord,
      her beauty seemed almost unearthly in its pure transparency of feature,
      outlined by the silver glimmer of the moonbeams; and the young man by her
      side, with his handsome dark head, tall figure and distinguished bearing,
      looked the fitting mate for her fair, blossoming womanhood. No two lovers
      were ever more ideally matched in physical perfection; and as they moved
      slowly to and fro on the soft dark grass, brushing the dewy scent from
      hanging rose-boughs that pushed out inviting tufts of white and pink bloom
      here and there from the surrounding foliage, they would have served many a
      poet for some sweet idyll, or romance in rhyme, which should hold in its
      stanzas the magic of immortality. Yet there was a shade of uneasiness in
      the minds of both,&mdash;Prince Humphry was more silent than usual, and
      seemed absorbed in thought; and Gloria, looking timidly up from time to
      time at the dark poetic face of her 'sailor' lover, felt with a woman's
      quick instinct that something was troubling him, and remorsefully
      concluded that she was to blame,&mdash;that he had heard of her having
      been seen by the King, and that he was evidently vexed by it. He had
      arrived that evening suddenly and unexpectedly; for she and her 'little
      father,' as she called Réné Ronsard, had just begun their frugal supper,
      when the Crown Prince's yacht swept into the bay and dropped anchor. Half
      an hour later he, the much-beloved 'junior officer' in the Crown Prince's
      service had appeared at the cottage door, greatly to their delight, for
      they did not expect to see him so soon. They had supped together, and then
      Ronsard himself had gone to superintend a meeting at a small social club
      he had started for the amusement of the fisher-folk, wisely leaving the
      young wedded lovers to themselves. And they had for a long time been very
      quiet, save for such little words of love as came into tune with the
      interchange of caresses,&mdash;and after a pause of anxious inward
      thought, Gloria ventured on a timid query.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dearest,&mdash;are you <i>very</i> angry with me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He started,&mdash;and stopping in his walk, turned the fair face up
      between his two hands, as one might lift a rose on its stem, and kissed it
      tenderly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Angry? How can I ever be angry with you, Sweet? Besides what cause have I
      for anger?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thought, perhaps&mdash;" murmured Gloria, "that if the Professor told
      you what I did yesterday,&mdash;when the King came&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He did tell me;" and the Prince still gazed down on that heavenly beauty
      which was the light of the world to him. "He told me that you sang;&mdash;and
      that your golden voice was a musical magnet which drew his Majesty to your
      feet! I am not surprised,&mdash;it was only natural! But I could have
      wished it had not happened just yet; however, it has happened, and we must
      make the best of it!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was my fault," said the girl penitently;&mdash;"I had the fancy to
      sing; and I <i>would</i> sing, though the good Professor told me not to do
      so!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The Prince was silent. He was bracing his mind to the inevitable. He had
      determined that on this very night Gloria should know the truth. For he
      was instinctively certain that if he went abroad, as his father wished him
      to do, some means would be taken to remove her altogether from the country
      before his return; and his idea was to tell her all, and make her
      accompany him on his travels. As his wife, she was bound to obey him, he
      argued within himself; she should, she must go with him! Unconsciously
      Gloria's next words supplied him with an opening to the subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why did you never tell me that the Professor was in the King's service?"
      she asked. "He seemed to know him quite well,&mdash;indeed, almost as a
      friend!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He is the King's physician," answered the Prince abruptly; "And,
      therefore, he is very greatly in the King's confidence."
    </p>
    <p>
      He walked on, still keeping his arm round her, and seemed not to see the
      half-frightened glance she gave him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The King's physician!" she echoed;&mdash;"He does not seem a great person
      at all,&mdash;he is quite a simple old German man!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Her lover smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      "To be physician to the King, my Gloria, is not a very wonderful honour!
      It merely implies that the man so chosen is perhaps the ablest fencer with
      sickness and death; the greatness is in the simple old German himself, not
      in the King's preference. Von Glauben is a good man."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know it;" said Gloria gently; "He is good,&mdash;and very kind. He said
      he would always be my friend,&mdash;but he was very strange in his manner
      yesterday, and almost I was vexed with him. Do you know what he said? He
      asked me what I should do if you&mdash;my husband, had deceived me? Can
      you imagine such a thing?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Now was the supreme moment. With a violently beating heart the Prince
      halted, and putting both arms round her waist, drew her up to him in such
      a way that their eyes looked close into each other's, and their lips were
      within kissing touch.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, my sweetest one! I can imagine such a thing! Such a thing is
      possible! Consider it to be true! Consider that I <i>have</i> deceived
      you!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not move from his clasp, but into her large, lovely trusting eyes
      came a look of grief and terror, and her face grew ashy pale.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In what way?" she whispered faintly; "Tell me! I&mdash;I&mdash;cannot
      believe it!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Gloria,&mdash;Gloria! My love, my darling! Do not tremble so! Do not
      fear! I have not deceived you in any evil way,&mdash;what I have done was
      for your good and mine; but now&mdash;now there is no longer any need of
      deception,&mdash;you may, and <i>shall</i> know all the truth, my wife, my
      dearest in the world! You shall know me as I truly am at last!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She moved restlessly in his strong clasp,&mdash;she was trembling from
      head to foot, as if her blood was suddenly chilled.
    </p>
    <p>
      "As you truly are!" she echoed, with pale lips&mdash;"Are you not then
      what I have believed you to be?"
    </p>
    <p>
      And she made an effort to withdraw herself entirely from his embrace. But
      he held her fast.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am your husband, Gloria!" he said, "and you are my wife! Nothing can
      alter that; nothing can change our love or disunite our lives. But I am
      not the poor naval officer I have represented myself to be!&mdash;though I
      am glad I adopted such a disguise, because by its aid I wooed and won your
      love! I am not in the service of the Crown Prince,&mdash;except in so far
      as I serve my own needs! Why, how you tremble!"&mdash;and he held her
      closer&mdash;"Do not be afraid, my darling! Lift up your eyes and look at
      me with your own sweet trusting look,&mdash;do not turn away from me,
      because instead of being the Prince's servant, I am the Prince himself!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Prince!" And with a cry of utter desolation, Gloria wrenched herself
      out of his arms, and stood apart, looking at him in wild alarm and
      bewilderment. "The Prince! You&mdash;you!&mdash;my husband! You,&mdash;the
      King's son! And you have married <i>me</i>!&mdash;oh, how cruel of you!&mdash;how
      cruel!&mdash;how cruel!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Covering her face with her hands, she broke into a low sobbing,&mdash;and
      the Prince, cut to the heart by her distress, caught her again in his
      arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hush, Gloria!" he said, with an accent of authority, though his own voice
      was tremulous; "You must not grieve like this! You will break my heart! Do
      you not understand? Do you not see that all my life is bound up in you?&mdash;that
      I give it to you to do what you will with?&mdash;that I care nothing for
      rank, state or throne without you?&mdash;that I will let all the world go
      rather than lose you? Gloria, do not weep so!&mdash;do not weep! Every
      tear of yours is a pang to me! What does it matter whether I am prince or
      commoner? I love you!&mdash;we love each other!&mdash;we are one in the
      sight of Heaven!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He held her passionately in his arms, kissing the soft clusters of hair
      that fell against his breast, and whispering all the tenderest words of
      endearment he could think of to console and soothe her anguish. By degrees
      she grew calmer, and her sobs gradually ceased. Dashing the tears from her
      eyes, she looked up,&mdash;her face white as marble.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You must not tell Ronsard!" she said in faint tones that shook with fear;
      "He would kill you!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The Prince smiled indulgently; his only thought was for her, and so long
      as he could dry her tears, Ronsard's rage or pleasure was nothing to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He would kill you!" repeated Gloria, with wide open tear-wet eyes; "He
      hates all kings, in his heart!&mdash;and if he knew that you&mdash;<i>you</i>&mdash;my
      husband,&mdash;were what you say you are;&mdash;if he thought you had
      married me under a disguise, only to leave me and never to want me any
      more&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Gloria, Gloria!" cried the Prince, in despair; "Why will you say such
      things! Never to want you any more! I want you all my life, and every
      moment of that life! Gloria, you must listen to me&mdash;you must not turn
      from me at the very time I need you most! Are you not brave? Are you not
      true? Do you not love me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      With a pathetic gesture she stretched out her hands to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, yes, I love you!" she said; "I love you with all my heart! But you
      have deceived me!&mdash;my dearest, you have deceived me! And if you had
      only told me the truth, I would never,&mdash;for your own sake,&mdash;have
      married you!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know that!" said the Prince; "And that is why I determined to win you
      under the mask of poverty! Now listen, my Princess and my Queen!&mdash;for
      you are both! I want all your help&mdash;all your love&mdash;all your
      trust! Do not be afraid of Ronsard; he will, he can do nothing to harm me!
      You are my wife, Gloria,&mdash;you have promised before God to obey me! I
      claim your obedience!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She stood silent, looking at him,&mdash;pale and fair as an ivory statue
      of Psyche, seen against the dark background of the heavily-branched trees.
      Her mind was stunned and confused; she had not yet grasped the full
      consciousness of her position,&mdash;but as he spoke, the old primitive
      lessons of faith, steadfastness of purpose, and unwavering love and trust
      in God, which her adopted father had instilled into her from childhood,
      rose and asserted their sway over her startled, but unspoilt soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You need not claim it!" she said, slowly; "It is yours always! I shall do
      whatever you tell me, even if you command me to die for your sake!"
    </p>
    <p>
      With a swift impulsive action, full of grace and spirit, he dropped on one
      knee and kissed her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And so I pledge my faith to my Queen!" he said joyously. "Gloria! my
      'Glory-of-the-Sea'!&mdash;you will forgive me for having in this one thing
      misled you? Think of me as your sailor lover still!&mdash;it is a much
      harder thing to be a king's son than a simple, independent seafarer! Pity
      me for my position, and help me to make it endurable! Come now with me
      down to that rocky nook on the shore where I first saw you,&mdash;and I
      will tell you exactly how everything stands,&mdash;and how I trust to your
      love for me and your courage, to clear away all the difficulties before
      us. You do not love me less?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I could not love you less!" she replied slowly; "but I cannot think of
      you as quite the same!"
    </p>
    <p>
      A shadow of pain darkened his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Gloria," he said sadly; "If your love was as great as mine you would
      forgive!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She stood a moment wavering and uncertain; their eyes were riveted on each
      other in a strange spiritual attraction&mdash;her soft lips were a little
      relaxed from their gravity as she steadfastly regarded him. She was
      embarrassed, conscious, and very pale; but he drank in gratefully the
      wonder and shy worship of those pure eyes,&mdash;and waited. Suddenly she
      sprang to him and closed her arms about his neck, kissing him with simple
      and loving tenderness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do forgive! Oh, I do forgive!" she murmured; "Because I love you, my
      darling&mdash;because I love you! Whatever you wish I will do for your
      love's sake&mdash;believe me!&mdash;but I am frightened just now!&mdash;it
      is as if I did not know you&mdash;as if someone had taken you suddenly a
      long way off! Give me a little time to recover my courage!&mdash;and to
      know"&mdash;here a faint smile trembled on her beautiful curved mouth&mdash;"to
      know,&mdash;and to <i>feel</i>,&mdash;that you are still my own!&mdash;even
      though the world may try to part you from me!&mdash;still my very own!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The warmth of passionate feeling in her face flushed it into a rose-glow
      that spread from chin to brow,&mdash;and clasping her to his breast, he
      gave her the speechless answer that love inscribes on eyes and lips,&mdash;then,
      keeping his arm tenderly about her, he led her gently into the path
      through the pinewood, which wound down to their favourite haunt by the
      sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      The moonlight had now increased in brilliancy, and illumined the landscape
      with all the opulence, splendour and superabundance of radiance common to
      the south,&mdash;the air was soft and balmy, and one great white cloud
      floating lazily under the silver orb, moved slowly to the centre of the
      heavens,&mdash;the violet-blue of night falling around it like an imperial
      robe of state. The two youthful figures passed under the pine-boughs,
      which closed over them odorously in dark arches of shadow, and wended
      their slow way down to the seashore, from whence they could see the Royal
      yacht lying at anchor, every tapering line of her fair proportions
      distinctly outlined against the sky, and all her masts shining as if they
      had been washed with silver dew; and the Heir-Apparent to a throne was,&mdash;for
      once in the history of Heir-Apparents,&mdash;happy&mdash;happy in knowing
      that he was loved as princes seldom or never are loved,&mdash;not for his
      power, not for his rank, but simply for himself alone, by one of the most
      beautiful women in the world, who,&mdash;if she knew neither the ways of a
      Court, nor the wiles of fashion,&mdash;had something better than either of
      these,&mdash;the sanctity of truth and the strength of innocence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Réné Ronsard, coming back from his pleasurable duties as host and chairman
      to his fishermen-friends, found the cottage deserted, and smiled, as he
      sat himself down in the porch to smoke, and to wait for the lover's
      return.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What a thing it is to be young!" he sighed, as he gazed meditatively at
      the still beauty of the night around him;&mdash;"To be young,&mdash;and in
      love with the right person! Hours go like moments&mdash;the grass is never
      damp&mdash;the air is never cold&mdash;there is never time enough to give
      all the kisses that are waiting to be given; and life is so beautiful,
      that we are almost able to understand why God created the universe! The
      rapture passes very quickly, unfortunately&mdash;with some people;&mdash;but
      if I ever prayed for anything&mdash;which I do not&mdash;I should pray
      that it might remain with Gloria! It surely cannot offend the Supreme
      Being who is responsible for our existence, to see one woman happy out of
      all the tortured millions of them! One exception to the universal rule
      would not make much difference! The law that the strong should prey on the
      weak, nearly always prevails,&mdash;but it is possible to hope and believe
      that on rare occasions the strong may be magnanimous!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He smoked on placidly, considering various points of philosophic
      meditation, and by and by fell into a gentle doze. The doze deepened into
      a dream which grew sombre and terrible,&mdash;and in it he thought he saw
      himself standing bareheaded on a raised platform above surging millions of
      people who all shouted with one terrific uproar of unison&mdash;"Regicide!
      Regicide!" He looked down upon his hands, and saw them red with blood!&mdash;he
      looked up to the heavens, and they were flushed with the same ominous hue.
      Blood!&mdash;blood!&mdash;the blood of kings,&mdash;the dust of thrones!&mdash;and
      he, the cause! Choked and tormented with a parching thirst, it seemed in
      the dream that he tried to speak,&mdash;and with all his force he cried
      out&mdash;"For her sake I did it! For her sake!" But the clamour of the
      crowd drowned his voice,&mdash;and then it was as if the coldness of death
      crept slowly over him,&mdash;slowly and cruelly, as though his whole body
      were being enclosed within an iceberg,&mdash;and he saw Gloria, the child
      of his love and care, laid out before him dead,&mdash;but robed and
      crowned like a queen, and placed on a great golden bier of state, with
      purple velvet falling about her, and tall candles blazing at her head and
      feet. And voices sang in his ears&mdash;"Gloria! Gloria in excelsis Deo!"&mdash;mingling
      with the muffled chanting of priests at some distant altar; and he thought
      he made an attempt to touch the royal velvet pall that draped her
      beautiful lifeless body, when he was roughly thrust back by armed men with
      swords and bayonets who asked him "What do you here? Are you not her
      murderer?"&mdash;and he cried out wildly "No, no! Never could I have
      harmed the child of my love! Never could I hurt a hair of her head, or
      cause her an hour's sorrow! She is all I had in the world!&mdash;I loved
      her!&mdash;I loved her! Let me see her!&mdash;let me touch her!&mdash;let
      me kiss her once again!" And then the scene suddenly changed,&mdash;and it
      was found that Gloria was not dead at all, but walking peacefully alone in
      a garden of flowers, with lilies crowning her, and all the sunshine about
      her; and that the golden bier of state had changed into a ship at sea
      which was floating, floating westward bearing some great message to a far
      country, and that all was well for him and his darling. The troubled
      vision cleared from his brain, and his sleep grew calmer; he breathed more
      easily, and flitting glimpses of fair scenes passed before his dreaming
      eyes,&mdash;scenes in some peaceful and beautiful world, where never a
      shadow of sorrow or trouble darkened the quiet contentment of happy and
      innocent lives. He smiled in his sleep, and heaved a deep sigh of
      pleasure,&mdash;and so, gently awoke, to feel a light touch on his
      shoulder, and to see Gloria standing before him. A smile was on her face,&mdash;the
      fragrance of the woodlands and the sea clung about her garments,&mdash;she
      held a few roses in her hand, and there was something in her whole
      appearance that struck him as new, commanding, and more than ever
      beautiful.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have returned alone?" he said wonderingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. I have returned alone! I have much to tell you, dear! Let us go in!"

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIX. &mdash; OF THE CORRUPTION OF THE STATE
    </h2>
    <p>
      The large gaunt building, which was dignified by the name of the 'People's
      Assembly Rooms,' stood in a dim unfashionable square of the city which had
      once been entirely devoted to warehouses and storage cellars. It had
      originally served a useful purpose in providing temporary shelter for
      foreign-made furniture, which was badly constructed and intrinsically
      worthless,&mdash;but which, being cheaply imported and showy in
      appearance, was patronized by some of the upper middle-classes in
      preference to goods of their own home workmanship. Lately, however, the
      foreign import had fallen to almost less than nothing; and whether or no
      this was due to the secret machinations of Sergius Thord and his
      Revolutionary Committee, no one would have had the hardihood to assert.
      Foreign tradesmen, however, and foreign workmen generally had certainly
      experienced a check in their inroads upon home manufactures, and some of
      the larger business firms had been so successfully intimidated as to set
      up prominent announcements outside their warehouses to the effect that
      "Only native workmen need apply." Partly in consequence of the "slump" in
      foreign goods, the "Assembly Rooms," as a mere building had for some time
      been shut up, and given over to dust and decay, till the owners of the
      property decided to let it out for popular concerts, meetings and dances,
      and so make some little money out of its bare whitewashed walls and
      comfortless ugliness. The plan had succeeded fairly well, and the place
      was beginning to be known as a convenient centre where thousands were wont
      to congregate, to enjoy cheap music and cheap entertainment generally. It
      was a favourite vantage ground for the disaffected and radical classes of
      the metropolis to hold forth on their wrongs, real or imaginary,&mdash;and
      the capacities of the largest room or hall in the building were put to
      their utmost extent to hold the enormous audiences that always assembled
      to hear the picturesque, passionate and striking oratory of Sergius Thord.
    </p>
    <p>
      But there were one or two rare occasions when even Sergius Thord's
      attractions as a speaker were thrown into the background, by the
      appearance of that mysterious personality known as Lotys,&mdash;concerning
      whom a thousand extravagant stories were rife, none of which were true. It
      was rumoured among other things as wild and strange, that she was the
      illegitimate child of a certain great prince, whose amours were legion&mdash;that
      she had been thrown out into the street to perish, deserted as an infant,
      and that Sergius Thord had rescued her from that impending fate of
      starvation and death,&mdash;and that it was by way of vengeance for the
      treatment of her mother by the Exalted Personage involved, that she had
      thrown in her lot with the Revolutionary party, to aid their propaganda by
      her intellectual gifts, which were many. She was known to be very poor,&mdash;she
      lived in cheap rooms in a low quarter of the city; she was seldom or never
      seen in the public thoroughfares,&mdash;she appeared to have no women
      friends, and she certainly mixed in no form of social intercourse or
      entertainment. Yet her name was on the lips of the million, and her
      influence was felt far beyond the city's radius. Even among some of the
      highest and wealthiest classes of society this peculiar appellation of
      "Lotys," carrying no surname with it, and spoken at haphazard had the
      effect of causing a sudden silence, and the interchange of questioning
      looks among those who heard it, and who, without knowing who she was, or
      what her aims in life really were, voted her "dangerous." Those among the
      superior classes who had by rare chance seen her, were unanimous in their
      verdict that she was not beautiful,&mdash;"but!"&mdash;and the "but" spoke
      volumes. She was known to possess something much less common, and far more
      potent than beauty,&mdash;and that was a fascinating, compelling spiritual
      force, which magnetised into strange submission all who came within its
      influence,&mdash;and many there were who admitted, though with bated
      breath that 'An' if she chose' she could easily become a very great
      personage indeed.
    </p>
    <p>
      She herself was, or seemed to be, perfectly unconscious of the many
      discussions concerning her and her origin. She had her own secret sorrows,&mdash;her
      sad private history, which she shut close within her own breast,&mdash;but
      out of many griefs and poverty-stricken days of struggle and cruel
      environment, she had educated herself to a wonderful height of moral
      self-control and almost stoical rectitude. Her nature was a broad and
      grand one, absolutely devoid of pettiness, and full of a strong, almost
      passionate sympathy with the wrongs of others,&mdash;and she had formed
      herself on such firm, heroic lines of courage and truth and self-respect,
      that the meaner vices of her sex were absolutely unknown to her. Neither
      vanity, nor envy, nor malice, nor spleen disturbed the calmly-flowing
      current of her blood,&mdash;her soul was absorbed in pity for human kind,
      and contemplation of its many woes,&mdash;and so living alone, and
      studiously apart from the more frivolous world, she had attained a finely
      tempered and deeply thoughtful disposition which gave her equally the
      courage of the hero and the resignation of the martyr. She had long put
      away out of her life all possibility of happiness for herself. She had, by
      her unwearying study of the masses of working, suffering men and women,
      come to the sorrowful conclusion that real happiness could only be enjoyed
      by the extremely young, and the extremely thoughtless,&mdash;and that love
      was only another name for the selfish and often cruel and destructive
      instincts of animal desire. She did not resent these ugly facts, or
      passionately proclaim against the gloomy results of life such as were
      daily displayed to her,&mdash;she was only filled with a profound and
      ceaseless compassion for the evils which were impossible to cure. Her
      tireless love for the sick, the feeble, the despairing, the broken-hearted
      and the dying, had raised her to the height of an angel's quality among
      the very desperately poor and criminal classes;&mdash;the fiercest
      ruffians of the slums were docile in her presence and obedient to her
      command;&mdash;and many a bold plan of robbery,&mdash;many a wicked scheme
      of murder had been altogether foregone and abandoned through the
      intervention of Lotys, whose intellectual acumen, swift to perceive the
      savage instinct, or motive for crime, was equally swift to point out its
      uselessness as a means of satisfying vengeance. No preacher could persuade
      a thief of the practical ingloriousness of thieving, as Lotys could,&mdash;and
      a prison chaplain, remonstrating with an assassin after his crime, was not
      half as much use to the State as Lotys, who could induce such an one to
      resign his murderous intent altogether, before he had so much as possessed
      himself of the necessary weapon. Thousands of people were absolutely under
      her moral dominion,&mdash;and the power she exercised over them was so
      great, and yet so unobtrusive, that had she bidden the whole city rise in
      revolt, she would most surely have been obeyed by the larger and fiercer
      half of its population.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the moneyed classes she had nothing in common, though she viewed them
      with perhaps more pity than she did the very poor. An overplus of cash in
      any one person's possession that had not been rightfully earned by the
      work of brain or body, was to her an incongruity, and a defection from the
      laws of the universe;&mdash;show and ostentation she despised,&mdash;and
      though she loved beautiful things, she found them,&mdash;as she herself
      said,&mdash;much more in the everyday provisions of nature, than in the
      elaborate designs of art. When she passed the gay shops in the principal
      thoroughfares she never paused to look in at the jewellers' windows,&mdash;but
      she would linger for many minutes studying the beauty of the sprays of
      orchids and other delicate blossoms, arranged in baskets and vases by the
      leading florists; while,&mdash;best delight of all to her, was a solitary
      walk inland among the woods, where she could gather violets and narcissi,
      and, as she expressed it 'feel them growing about her feet.' She would
      have been an extraordinary personality as a man,&mdash;as a woman she was
      doubly remarkable, for to a woman's gentleness she added a force of will
      and brain which are not often found even in the stronger sex.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mysterious as she was in her life and surroundings, enough was known of
      her by the people at large, to bring a goodly concourse of them to the
      Assembly Rooms on the night when she was announced to speak on a subject
      of which the very title seemed questionable, namely, "On the Corruption of
      the State." The police had been notified of the impending meeting, and a
      few stalwart emissaries of the law in plain clothes mixed with the
      in-pouring throng. The crowd, however, was very orderly;&mdash;there was
      no pushing, no roughness, and no coarse language. All the members of
      Sergius Thord's Revolutionary Committee were present, but they came as
      stragglers, several and apart,&mdash;and among them Paul Zouche the poet,
      was perhaps the most noticeable. He had affected the picturesque in his
      appearance;&mdash;his hat was of the Rembrandt character, and he had
      donned a very much worn, short velveteen jacket, whose dusty brown was
      relieved by the vivid touch of a bright red tie. His hair was wild and
      bushy, and his eyes sparkled with unwonted brilliancy, as he nodded to one
      or two of his associates, and gave a careless wave of the hand to Sergius
      Thord, who, entering slowly, and as if with reluctance, took a seat at the
      very furthest end of the hall, where his massive figure showed least
      conspicuous among the surging throng. Keeping his head down in a pensive
      attitude of thought, his eyes were, nevertheless, sharp to see every
      person entering who belonged to his own particular following,&mdash;and a
      ray of satisfaction lighted up his face, as he perceived his latest new
      associate, Pasquin Leroy, quietly edge his way through the crowd, and
      secure a seat in one of the obscurest and darkest corners of the badly
      lighted hall. He was followed by his comrades, Max Graub and Axel Regor,&mdash;and
      Thord felt a warm glow of contentment in the consciousness that these
      lately enrolled members of the Revolutionary Committee were so far
      faithful to their bond. Signed and sealed in the blood of Lotys, they had
      responded to the magnetism of her name with the prompt obedience of waves
      rising to the influence of the moon,&mdash;and Sergius, full of a thousand
      wild schemes for the regeneration of the People, was more happy to know
      them as subjects to her power, than as adherents to his own cause. He was
      calmly cognisant of the presence of General Bernhoff, the well-known Chief
      of Police;&mdash;though he was rendered a trifle uneasy by observing that
      personage had seated himself as closely as possible to the bench occupied
      by Leroy and his companions. A faint wonder crossed his mind as to whether
      the three, in their zeal for the new Cause they had taken up, had by any
      means laid themselves open to suspicion; but he was not a man given to
      fears; and he felt convinced in his own mind, from the close personal
      observation he had taken of Leroy, and from the boldness of his speech on
      his enrolment as a member of the Revolutionary Committee, that, whatever
      else he might prove to be, he was certainly no coward.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hall filled quickly, till by and by it would have been impossible to
      find standing room for a child. A student of human nature is never long in
      finding out the dominant characteristic of an audience,&mdash;whether its
      attitude be profane or reverent, rowdy or attentive, and the bearing of
      the four or five thousand here assembled was remarkable chiefly for its
      seriousness and evident intensity of purpose. The extreme orderliness of
      the manner in which the people found and took their seats,&mdash;the
      entire absence of all fussy movement, fidgeting, staring, querulous
      changing of places, whispering or laughter, showed that the crowd were
      there for a deeper purpose than mere curiosity. The bulk of the assemblage
      was composed of men; very few women were present, and these few were all
      of the poor and hard-working classes. No female of even the lower middle
      ranks of life, with any faint pretence to 'fashion,' would have been seen
      listening to "that dreadful woman,"&mdash;as Lotys was very often called
      by her own sex,&mdash;simply because of the extraordinary fascination she
      secretly exercised over men. Pasquin Leroy and his companions spoke now
      and then, guardedly, and in low whispers, concerning the appearance and
      demeanour of the crowd, Max Graub being particularly struck by the general
      physiognomy and type of the people present.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Plenty of good heads!" he said cautiously. "There are thinkers here&mdash;and
      thinkers are a very dangerous class!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "There are many people who 'think' all their lives and 'do' nothing!" said
      Axel Regor languidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "True, my friend! But their thought may lead, while, they themselves
      remain passive," joined in Pasquin Leroy sotto-voce;&mdash;"It is not at
      all impossible that if Lotys bade these five thousand here assembled burn
      down the citadel, it would be done before daybreak!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have no doubt at all of that," said Graub. "One cannot forget that the
      Bastille was taken while the poor King Louis XVI. was enjoying a
      supper-party and 'a little orange-flower-water refreshment' at
      Versailles!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Leroy made an imperative sign of silence, for there was a faint stir and
      subdued hum of expectation in the crowd. Another moment,&mdash;and Lotys
      stepped quietly and alone on the bare platform. As she confronted her
      audience, a low passionate sound, like the murmur of a rising storm,
      greeted her,&mdash;a sound that was not anything like the customary
      applause or encouragement offered to a public speaker, but that suggested
      extraordinary satisfaction and expectancy, which almost bordered on
      exultation. Pasquin Leroy, raising his eyes as she entered, was startled
      by an altogether new impression of her to that which he had received on
      the night he first saw her. Her personality was somehow different&mdash;her
      appearance more striking, brilliant and commanding. Attired in the same
      plain garment of dead white serge in which he had previously seen her,
      with the same deep blood-red scarf crossing her left shoulder and breast,&mdash;there
      was something to-night in this mere costume that seemed emblematic of a
      far deeper power than he had been at first inclined to give her. A curious
      sensation began to affect his nerves,&mdash;a sudden and overwhelming
      attraction, as though his very soul were being drawn out of him by the
      calm irresistible dominance of those slumbrous dark-blue iris-coloured
      eyes, which had the merit of appearing neither brilliant nor remarkable as
      eyes merely, but which held in their luminous depths that intellectual
      command which represents the active and passionate life of the brain,
      beside which all other life is poor and colourless. These eyes appeared to
      rest upon him now from under their drooping sleepy white eyelids with an
      inexpressible tenderness and fascination, and he was suddenly reminded of
      Heinrich Heine's quaint love-fancy; "Behind her dreaming eyelids the sun
      has gone to rest; when she opens her eyes it will be day, and the birds
      will be heard singing!" He began to realise depths in his own nature which
      he had till now been almost unconscious of; he knew himself to a certain
      extent, but by no means thoroughly; and awakening as he was to the fact
      that other lives around him presented strange riddles for consideration,
      he wondered whether after all, his own life might not perhaps prove one of
      the most complex among human conundrums? He had often meditated on the
      inaccessibility of ideal virtues, the uselessness of persuasion, the
      commonplace absurdity, as he had thought, of trying to embody any lofty
      spiritual dream,&mdash;yet he was himself a man in whom spiritual forces
      were so strong that he was personally unaware of their overflow, because
      they were as much a part of him as his breathing capacity. True, he had
      never consciously tested them, but they were existent in him nevertheless.
    </p>
    <p>
      He watched Lotys now, with an irritable, restless attention,&mdash;there
      was a thrill of vague expectation in his soul as of new things to be done,&mdash;changes
      to be made in the complex machinery of human nature,&mdash;and a great
      wonder, as well as a great calm, fell upon him as the first clear steady
      tones of her voice chimed through the deep hush which had prepared the way
      for her first words. Her voice was a remarkable one, vibrant, yet gentle,&mdash;ringing
      out forcefully, yet perfectly sweet. She began very simply,&mdash;without
      any attempt at a majestic choice of words, or an impressive flow of
      oratory. She faced her audience quietly,&mdash;one bare rounded arm
      resting easily on a small uncovered deal table in front of her;&mdash;she
      had no 'notes' but her words were plainly the result of deliberate and
      careful thinking-out of certain problems needful to be brought before the
      notice of the people. Her face was colourless,&mdash;the dead gold hair
      rippling thickly away in loose clusters from the white brows, fell into
      their accustomed serpentine twisted knot at the nape of her neck; and the
      scarlet sash she wore, alone relieved the statuesque white folds of her
      draperies; but as she spoke, something altogether superphysical seemed to
      exhale from her as heat exhales from fire&mdash;a strange essence of
      overpowering and compelling sweetness stole into the heavy heated air, and
      gave to the commonplace surroundings and the poorly clothed crowd of
      people an atmosphere of sacredness and beauty. This influence deepened
      steadily under the rhythmic cadence of her voice, till every agitated
      soul, every resentful and troubled heart in the throng was conscious of a
      sudden ingathering of force and calm, of self-respect and self-reliance.
      The gist of her intention was plainly to set people thinking for
      themselves, and in this there could be no manner of doubt but that she
      succeeded. Of the 'Corruption of the State' she spoke as a thing
      thoroughly recognised by the masses.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We know,&mdash;all of us,"&mdash;she said, in the concluding portion of
      her address, "that we have Ministers who personally care nothing for the
      prosperity or welfare of the country. We know&mdash;all of us,&mdash;that
      we have a bribed Press; whose business it is to say nothing that shall run
      counter to Ministerial views. We know,&mdash;all of us,&mdash;that it is
      this bribed Ministerial press which leads the ignorant, (who are not
      behind the scenes,) to wrong and false conclusions;&mdash;and that it is
      solely upon these wrong and false conclusions of the wilfully misled
      million, that the Ministry itself rests for support. On one side the Press
      is manipulated by the Jews; on the other by the Jesuits. There is no
      journal in this country that will, or dare, publish the true reflex of
      popular opinion. Therefore the word 'free' cannot be applied to that
      recording-force of nations which we call Journalism; inasmuch as it is now
      a merely purchased Chattle. We should remember, when we read 'opinions of
      the Press,'&mdash;on any great movement or important change in policy,
      that we are merely accepting the opinions of the bound and paid Slave of
      Capitalists;&mdash;and we should take care to form our judgment for
      ourselves, rather than from the Capitalist point of view. Were there a
      strong man to lead,&mdash;the shiftiness, treachery, and deliberate
      neglect practised on the million by those who are now in office, could not
      possibly last;&mdash;but where there is no strength, there must be
      weakness,&mdash;and where a long career of deceit has been followed,
      instead of a course of plain dealing, failure in the end is inevitable.
      With failure comes disaster; and often something which augments disaster&mdash;Revolt.
      The people, weary of constant imposition,&mdash;of incessant delays of the
      justice due to them,&mdash;as well as the unscrupulous breaking of
      promises solemnly pledged,&mdash;will&mdash;in the long run, take their
      own way, as they have done before in history, of securing instant
      amelioration of those wrongs which their paid rulers fail to redress. Who
      will dare to say that, under such circumstances, it is ill for the people
      to act? Sometimes it is a greater Consciousness than their own that moves
      them; and the wronged and half-forgotten Cause of all worlds makes His
      command known through His creatures, who obey His impulse,&mdash;even as
      the atoms gathering in space cluster at His will into solar systems, and
      bring forth their burden of life!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She paused, and leaning forward a little, her eyes poured out their
      flashing searchlight as it seemed into the very souls of her hearers.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dear friends!&mdash;dear children!" she said, and in her tone there was
      the tenderness of a great compassion, almost bordering on tears,&mdash;"What
      is it, think you all, that makes the age in which we live so sad, so
      colourless, so restless and devoid of hope and peace? It is not that we
      are the inhabitants of a less wonderful or less beautiful world,&mdash;it
      is not as if the sun had ceased to shine, or the birds had forgotten how
      to sing! Triumphs of science,&mdash;triumphs of learning and discovery,
      these are all on the increase for our help and furtherance. With so much
      gain in evident advancement, what is it we have lost?&mdash;what is it we
      miss?&mdash;whence come the dreariness and emptiness and satiety,&mdash;the
      intolerable sense of the futility of life, even when life has most to
      offer? Dear children, you are all so sad!&mdash;many of you so
      broken-hearted!&mdash;why is it?&mdash;how is it? Poverty alone is not the
      cause,&mdash;for it is quite possible to be poor, yet happy! True enough
      it is that in these days you are ground down by the imposition of taxes,
      which try all the strength of your earnings to pay; but even this is an
      evil you could mitigate for yourselves, by strong and united public
      protest. How is it that you do not realise your own strength? You are not
      like the poor brutes of the field and forest, who lack the reason which
      would show them how superior in physical force alone they are to the
      insignificant biped who commands them. Could the ox understand his own
      strength, he would never be led to the slaughter-house;&mdash;he and his
      kind would become a terror instead of a provision. You are not oxen,&mdash;yet
      often you are as patient, as dull, as blind and reasonless as they! You
      form clubs, societies, and trades-unions;&mdash;but in how many cases do
      you not enter upon small and querulous differences which so weaken your
      unity that presently it falls to pieces and has no more power in it? This
      is what your tyrants in trade rely on and hope for; the constant
      recurrence of quarrels and dissensions among yourselves. No Society lasts
      which tolerates conflicting argument or differing sentiments in itself.
      Why is it that the Jesuits,&mdash;whom you are all unanimous in hating,&mdash;are
      still the strongest political Brotherhood on the face of the earth?
      Because they are bound to maintain in every particular the tenets of their
      Order. No matter how vile, or how reprehensibly false their theories, they
      are compelled to carry on the work and propaganda of their Union, despite
      all loss and sacrifice to themselves. This is the secret of their force.
      Expelled from one land, they take root in another. Suppressed entirely by
      Pope Clement XIV., in 1773, they virtually ignored suppression, and took
      up their headquarters in Russia. The influence they exerted there still
      lies on the serf population, like one of the many chains fastened to a
      Siberian exile's body. Yet they were driven from Russia in 1820,&mdash;from
      Holland in 1816,&mdash;from Switzerland in 1847, and from Germany in 1872.
      Latterly they have been expelled from France. Nevertheless, in spite of
      these numerous expulsions, and the universal odium in which they are held,&mdash;they
      still flourish; still are they able to maintain their twenty-two generals
      and their four Vicars;&mdash;and still all countries have, in their turn,
      to deal with their impending or fulfilled invasion. Why is it that a
      Society so criminal in historic annals, should yet remain as a force in
      our advanced era of civilization? Simply, because it is of One Mind! Bent
      on evil, or good,&mdash;self-renunciation or self-aggrandisement,&mdash;it
      is still of One Mind! Friends,&mdash;were you like them, also of One Mind,
      your injuries, your oppressions, your taxations would not last long! The
      remedy for all is easy, and rests with yourselves,&mdash;only yourselves!
      But some of you have lost heart&mdash;and other some have lost patience.
      You look round upon the squalid corners of this great city&mdash;you
      shudder at the cruelty of the daily life with which you have to contend,&mdash;you
      enter poor rooms, which you are compelled to call 'home,' where the sick
      and dying, the newly-born and the dead are huddled all together,&mdash;ten,
      and sometimes fifteen in one small den of four whitewashed walls;&mdash;and
      sickened and tired, you cry out 'Is life worth no more than this? Is God's
      scheme for the human race no more than this? Then why were we born at all?
      Or, being born, why may we not die at once, self-slain?' Ah, yes, dear
      friends!&mdash;you often feel like this; we all of us often feel like
      this! But&mdash;it is not God who has made life thus hard for you,&mdash;it
      is yourselves! It is you who consent to be down-trodden,&mdash;it is you
      who resign your freewill, your thought, your originality of character,
      into the dominating power of others. True,&mdash;wealth controls affairs
      to a vast extent nowadays,&mdash;but there is a stronger power than
      wealth, and that is Soul! It is not the possession of gold that has given
      the greatest men their position. This is a commercial age, we own,&mdash;and
      certainly,&mdash;because of the base and degrading love of accumulation,&mdash;Intellectuality
      is for the moment often set aside as something valueless&mdash;but
      whenever Intellectuality truly asserts itself, there is at once made
      visible an acting force of the Divine, which is practically limitless and
      irresistible. Think for yourselves, friends!&mdash;do not let a hired
      Press think for you! Think for yourselves&mdash;judge for yourselves, and
      act for yourselves! By your observation of a statesman's life, you shall
      know his capabilities. If he has once been a turncoat, he will be a
      turncoat again. If he has been known to speculate privately in a
      forthcoming political crisis, which he alone knows of in advance&mdash;&mdash;"

      Here the speaker was interrupted by what sounded more like a snarl than a
      shout. "Pérousse! Pérousse!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The name was hissed out, and tossed from one rank to another of the
      audience, and one or two of the police present glanced enquiringly towards
      Bernhoff their chief,&mdash;but he sat with folded arms and inscrutable
      demeanour, making no sign. Lotys raised her small, beautifully-shaped
      white hand to enjoin silence. She was obeyed instantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I speak of no one man," she said with deliberate emphasis; "I accuse no
      one man,&mdash;or any man! I say 'if' any man gambles with State policy,
      he is a traitor to the country! But such gambling is not a novelty in the
      history of nations. It has been practised over and over again. Only mark
      you all this one God's truth!&mdash;that whenever it <i>has</i> occurred&mdash;whenever
      the rulers of a State <i>are</i> corrupt,&mdash;whenever society sinks
      into such moral defilement that it sees nothing better, nothing higher
      than the love of money,&mdash;then comes the downfall!&mdash;then Ruin and
      Anarchy set up their dominion,&mdash;and Heaven's rage rolls out upon the
      offenders, till their offence be cleansed away in rivers of blood and
      tears!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She waited a moment,&mdash;and changing her attitude, seemed as it were,
      to project her thought into her audience, by the sudden passion of her
      commanding gesture, and the flash of her deep luminous eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We have heard of the Great Renunciation!" she said; "How God Himself took
      human form, and came to this low little earth to prove how nobly we should
      live and die! But in our day,&mdash;we with our preachers and teachers,
      our press and our parliamentary orators,&mdash;our atheistical statesmen
      on all hands, have come upon the Great Obliteration!&mdash;the
      Obliteration of God altogether in our ways of life! We push Him out, as if
      He were not. He is not in our Churches&mdash;He is not in our Laws&mdash;He
      is not in our Commerce. Only when we are brought low by pain and sickness&mdash;when
      we are confronted by death itself&mdash;then we call out 'God! God!' like
      cowards, praying for help from the Power we have negatived all our lives!
      Here is the evil, O children all!&mdash;we have forgotten Our Father! We
      arrange all our affairs in life without giving Him a thought! Our
      pleasures, our gains, our advantages,&mdash;are calculated without
      consulting His good pleasure. He is last, or not at all,&mdash;when He
      should be first, and in everything! The end of this is misery;&mdash;it
      must be so; it cannot by law be anything else. For what is God? Who is
      God? God is a name merely,&mdash;but we give it to that Unseen, but ever
      working Force which rules the Universe! The coldest atheist that ever
      breathed must own that somehow,&mdash;by some means or other,&mdash;the
      Universe <i>is</i> ruled,&mdash;for if it were not, we should know nothing
      of it. Therefore, when we set aside, or leave out the consciousness and
      acknowledgment of the Ruler, the ruling of our affairs must, of necessity,
      go wrong!
    </p>
    <p>
      "I cannot preach to you&mdash;I cannot out of my own conscience recommend
      to you one or the other form of faith as the way to peace and wisdom;&mdash;but
      I can and do Beseech you to remember the Note Dominant of this great
      Universe&mdash;the Note that sounds through high and low,&mdash;through
      small and great alike!&mdash;and that must and will in due course absorb
      all our discords into Everlasting Harmony! Try not to put this fact out of
      your lives,&mdash;that Justice and Order are the rule of the spheres; and
      that whenever we depart from these, even in the smallest contingency,
      confusion reigns. How hard it is to believe in Justice and Order, you will
      tell me,&mdash;when the poor are not treated with the same consideration
      as the rich,&mdash;and when money will buy place and position! True! It is
      hard to believe,&mdash;but it is believable nevertheless. As the lungs and
      the heart are the life of the human body, so are Justice and Order the
      life of the Universe,&mdash;and when these are pushed out of place, or
      become diseased in the composition of a human state or community, then the
      life of that state or community is threatened;&mdash;and unless remedies
      are quickly to hand, it must end. You all know the position of things
      among yourselves to-day;&mdash;you all know that there is no trust to be
      placed in Churches, Kings or Parliaments;&mdash;that the world is in a
      state of ferment and unrest,&mdash;moving towards Change;&mdash;change
      imminent&mdash;change, possibly, disastrous! And if it is You who know, it
      is likewise You who must seize the hour as it approaches!&mdash;seize it
      as you would seize a robber by the throat, and demand its business;&mdash;search
      its heart;&mdash;deprive it of its weapons;&mdash;and learn from it its
      message! A message it may be of wild alarm&mdash;of tearing up old
      conventions;&mdash;of thrusting forth old abuses; a message full of
      clamour and outcry&mdash;but whatever the uproar, doubt not that we shall
      hear the voice of the Forgotten God thundering in our ears at the close!
      We shall have found our way closer to Him&mdash;and with penitence and
      prayer, we shall ask to be forgiven for having wandered away from Him so
      long!
    </p>
    <p>
      "And will He not pardon? Yes,&mdash;He will, because He must! To Him we
      owe our existence;&mdash;He alone is responsible for our life, our
      probation, our progress, our striving through many errors towards
      Perfection! He, who sees all, must needs have pity for His creature Man!
      Out of the evolutions of a blind Time, He has made the poor weak human
      being, who in the first days of his sojourn on earth had neither covering
      nor home. Less protected than the beasts of the forest, he found himself
      compelled to Think!&mdash;to think out his own means of shelter,&mdash;to
      contrive his own weapons of defence. Slowly, and by painful degrees, from
      Savagery he has emerged to Civilization;&mdash;wherefore it is evident
      that his Maker meant Thought to be his first principle, and Action his
      second. He who does not work, shall not eat;&mdash;he who does not use all
      his faculties for improvement, shall by and by have none to use. Injustice
      and corruption are amongst us, merely because we ourselves have failed to
      resist their first inroads. Who is it that complains of wrong? Let him
      hasten to his own amending,&mdash;and he will find a thousand hands, a
      thousand hearts ready to work with him! All Nature is on the side of
      health in the body, as of health in the State. All Nature fights against
      disease,&mdash;physical and moral. Therefore do not,&mdash;dear friends
      and children!&mdash;sit idle and passive, submitting yourselves to be
      deceived, as if you had no force to withstand deception! Show that you
      hate lies, and will have none of them,&mdash;show that you will not be
      imposed upon&mdash;and decline to be led or governed by party agents, who
      persuade you to your own and your country's destruction! The voice of the
      People can no longer be heard in a purchased Press;&mdash;let it echo
      forth then, in stronger form than ephemeral print, which to-day is glanced
      at, and to-morrow is forgotten;&mdash;wherever and whenever you are given
      the chance to meet, and to speak, let your authority as the workers, the
      ratepayers, and supporters of the State be heard; and do not You, without
      whom even the King could not keep his throne, consent to be set aside as
      the Unvalued Majority! Prove, by your own firm attitude that without You,
      nothing can be done! It is time, oh people of my heart!&mdash;it is time
      you spoke clearly! God is moving His thought through your souls&mdash;God
      stirs in you the fear, the discontent, the suspicion that all is not well
      with your country;&mdash;and it is the Spirit of God which breathes in the
      warning note of the time&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  "'Hark to the voice of the time!
    The multitude think forthemselves,
    And weigh their condition each one;
    The drudge has a spirit sublime,
    And whether he hammers or delves,
    He reads when his labour is done;
    And learns, though he groan under poverty's ban,
    That freedom to Think, is the birthright of man!'
</pre>
    <p>
      "Learn," she continued,&mdash;as a low deep murmur of agreement ran
      through the room; "Learn to what strange uses God puts even such men of
      this world, whose sole existence has been for the cause of amassing money!
      They have acted as the merest machines, gathering in the millions;&mdash;gathering,
      gathering them in! For what purpose? Lo, they are smitten down in the
      prime of their lives, and the gold they have piled up is at once
      scattered! Much of it becomes used for educational purposes;&mdash;and
      some of these dead millionaires have, as it were thrown Education at the
      heads of the people, and almost pauperised it. Far away in Great Britain,
      a millionaire has recently made the Scottish University education 'free'
      to all students,&mdash;instead of, as it used to be, hard to get, and well
      worth working to win. Now,&mdash;through the wealth of one man, it is
      turned into a pauper's allowance;&mdash;like offering the smallest silver
      coin to a reduced gentleman. The pride,&mdash;the skill,&mdash;the
      self-renunciation,&mdash;the strong determination to succeed, which form
      fine character, and which taught the struggling student to win his own
      University education, are all wiped out;&mdash;there is no longer any
      necessity for the practice of these manly and self-sustaining virtues. The
      harm that will be done is probably not yet perceivable; but it will be
      incalculable. Education, turned into a kind of pauper's monopoly, will
      have widely different results to those just now imagined! But with all the
      contemptuous throwing out of the unneeded kitchen-waste of millionaires,&mdash;still
      Education is the thing to take at any price, and under any circumstances;&mdash;because
      it alone is capable of giving power! It alone will 'put down the mighty
      from their seats, and exalt the humble and the meek.' It alone will give
      us the force to fight our taskmasters with their own weapons, and to place
      them where they should be, coequal with us, but not superior,&mdash;considerate
      of us, but not commanding us,&mdash;and above all things, bound to make
      their records of such work as they do for the State&mdash;clean!"
    </p>
    <p>
      A hurricane of applause interrupted her,&mdash;she waited till it
      subsided, then went on quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There should be no scheming in the dark; no secret contracts for which we
      have to pay blindly;&mdash;no refusal to explain the way in which the
      people's hard-earned money is spent; and before foreign urbanities and
      diplomacies and concessions are allowed to take up time in the Senate, it
      is necessary that the frightful and abounding evils of our own land,&mdash;our
      own homes,&mdash;be considered. For this we purpose to demand redress,&mdash;and
      not only to demand it, but to obtain it! Ministers may refuse to hear us;
      but the Country's claims are greater than any Ministry! A King's
      displeasure may cause court-parasites to tremble&mdash;but a People's
      Honour is more to be guarded than a thousand thrones!"
    </p>
    <p>
      As she concluded with these words, she seemed to grow taller, nobler, more
      inspired and commanding,&mdash;and while the applause was yet shaking the
      rafters of the hall, she left the platform. Shouts of "Lotys! Lotys!" rang
      out again and again with passionate bursts of cheering,&mdash;and in
      response to it she came back, and by a slight gesture commanded silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dear friends, I thank you all for listening to me!" she said simply, her
      rich voice trembling a little; "I speak only with a woman's impulse and
      unwisdom&mdash;just as I think and feel&mdash;and always out of my great
      love for you! As you all know, I have no interests to serve;&mdash;I am
      only Lotys, your own poor friend,&mdash;one who works with you, and dwells
      among you, seeing and sharing your hard lives, and wishing with all my
      heart that I could help you to be happier and freer! My life is at your
      service,&mdash;my love for you is all too great for any words to express,&mdash;and
      my gratitude for your faith and trust in me forms my daily thanksgiving!
      Now, dear children all,&mdash;for you are truly as children in your
      patience, submission and obedience to bitter destiny!&mdash;I will ask you
      to disperse quietly without noise or confusion, or any trouble that may
      give to the paid men of law ungrateful work to do;&mdash;and in your
      homes, think of me!&mdash;remember my words!&mdash;and while you maintain
      order by the steadiness and reasonableness of your difficult lives, still
      avoid and resent that slavish obedience to the yoke fastened upon you by
      capitalists,&mdash;who have no other comfort to offer you in poverty than
      the workhouse; and no other remedy for the sins into which you are thrust
      by their neglect, than the prison! Take, and keep the rights of your
      humanity!&mdash;the right to think,&mdash;the right to speak,&mdash;the
      right to know what is being done with the money you patiently earn for
      others;&mdash;and work, all together in unity. Put aside all petty
      differences,&mdash;all small rancours and jealousies; and even as a
      Ministry may unite to defraud and deceive you, so do you, the People,
      unite to expose the fraud, and reject the deception! There is no voice so
      resonant and convincing as the voice of the public; there is no power on
      earth more strong or more irresistible than the power of the People!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She stood for one moment more,&mdash;silent; her eyes brilliant, her face
      beautiful with inspired thought,&mdash;then with a quiet, half-deprecatory
      gesture, in response to the fresh outbreak of passionate cheering, she
      retired from the platform. Pasquin Leroy, whose eyes had been riveted on
      her from the first to the last word of her oration, now started as from a
      dream, and rose up half-unconsciously, passing his hand across his brow,
      as though to exorcise some magnetic spell that had crept over his brain.
      His face was flushed, his pulses were throbbing quickly. His companions,
      Max Graub and Axel Regor, looked at him inquisitively. The audience was
      beginning to file out of the hall in orderly groups.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What next?" said Graub; "Shall ye go?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I suppose so," said Leroy, with a quick sigh, and forcing a smile; "But&mdash;I
      should have liked to speak with her&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      At that moment his shoulder was touched by a man he recognised as Johan
      Zegota. He gave the sign of the Revolutionary Committee bond, to which
      Leroy and his comrades responded.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will you all three come over the way?" whispered Zegota cautiously; "We
      are entertaining Lotys to supper at the inn opposite,&mdash;the landlord
      is one of us. Thord saw you sitting here, and sent me to ask you to join
      us."
    </p>
    <p>
      "With pleasure," assented Leroy; "We will come at once!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Zegota nodded and disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So you will see the end of this escapade!" said Max Graub, a trifle
      crossly. "It would have been much better to go home!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have enjoyed escapades in your time, have you not, my friend? Some
      even quite recently?" returned Leroy gaily. "One or two more will not hurt
      you!"
    </p>
    <p>
      They edged their way out among the quietly moving crowd, and happening to
      push past General Bernhoff, that personage gave an almost imperceptible
      salute, which Leroy as imperceptibly returned. It was clear that the Chief
      of Police was acquainted with Pasquin Leroy, the 'spy' on whose track he
      had been sent by Carl Pérousse, and moreover, that he was evidently in no
      hurry to arrest him. At any rate he allowed him to pass with his friends
      unmolested, out of the People's Assembly Rooms, and though he followed him
      across the road, 'shadowing him,' as it were, into a large tavern, whose
      lighted windows betokened some entertainment within, he did not enter the
      hostelry himself, but contented his immediate humour by walking past it to
      a considerable distance off, and then slowly back again. By and by Max
      Graub came out and beckoned to him, and after a little earnest
      conversation Bernhoff walked off altogether, the ring of his martial heels
      echoing for some time along the pavement, even after he had disappeared.
      And from within the lighted tavern came the sound of a deep, harmonious,
      swinging chorus&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  "Way, make way!&mdash;for our banner is unfurled,
      Let each man
stand by his neighbour!   The thunder of our footsteps shall roll
through the world,      In the March of the Men of Labour!"
</pre>
    <p>
      "Yes!" said Max Graub, pausing to listen ere re-entering the tavern&mdash;"If&mdash;and
      it is a great 'if'&mdash;if every man will stand by his neighbour, the
      thunder will be very loud,&mdash;and by all the deities that ever lived in
      the Heaven blue, it is a thunder that is likely to last some time! The
      possibility of standing by one's neighbour is the only doubtful point!"

      CHAPTER XX. &mdash; THE SCORN OF KINGS
    </h2>
    <p>
      Inside the tavern, from whence the singing proceeded, there was a strange
      scene,&mdash;somewhat disorderly yet picturesque. Lotys, seated at the
      head of a long supper-table, had been crowned by her admirers with a
      wreath of laurels,&mdash;and as she sat more or less silent, with a rather
      weary expression on her face, she looked like the impersonation of a
      Daphne, exhausted by the speed of her flight from pursuing Apollo. Beside
      her, nestling close against her caressingly, was a little girl with great
      black Spanish eyes,&mdash;eyes full of an appealing, half-frightened
      wistfulness, like those of a hunted animal. Lotys kept one arm round the
      child, and every now and again spoke to her some little caressing word.
      All the rest of the guests at the supper-board were men,&mdash;and all of
      them members of the Revolutionary Committee. When Pasquin Leroy and his
      friends entered, there was a general clapping of hands, and the pale
      countenance of Lotys flushed a delicate rose-red, as she extended her hand
      to each.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You begin your career with us very well!" she said gently, her eyes
      resting musingly on Leroy; "I had not expected to see you to-night!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Madame, I had never heard you speak," he answered; and as he addressed
      her, he pressed her hand with unconscious fervour, while his eloquent eyes
      dilated and darkened, as, moved by some complex emotion, she quickly
      withdrew her slender fingers from his clasp. "And I felt I should never
      know you truly as you are, till I saw you face the people. Now&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      He paused. She looked at him wonderingly, and her heart began to beat with
      a strange quick thrill. It is not always easy to see the outlines of a
      soul's development, or the inchoate formation of a great love,&mdash;and
      though everything in a certain sense moved her and appealed to her that
      was outside herself, it was difficult to her to believe or to admit that
      she, in her own person, might be the cause of an entirely new set of
      thoughts and emotions in the mind of one man. Seeing he was silent, she
      repeated softly and with a half smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Now'?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now," continued Leroy quickly, and in a half-whisper; "I do know you
      partly,&mdash;but I must know you more! You will give me the chance to do
      that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      His look said more than his words, and her face grew paler than before.
      She turned from him to the child at her side&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pequita, are you very tired?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No!" was the reply, given brightly, and with an upward glance of the dark
      eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is right! Pasquin Leroy my friend! this is Pequita,&mdash;the child
      we told you of the other night, the only daughter of Sholto. She will
      dance for us presently, will you not, my little one?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, indeed!" and the young face lighted up swiftly at the suggestion;
      while Leroy, taking the seat indicated to him at the supper-table,
      experienced a tumult of extraordinary sensations,&mdash;the chief one of
      which was, that he felt himself to have been 'snubbed,' very quietly but
      effectually, by a woman who had succeeded, though he knew not how, in
      suddenly awakening in him a violent fever of excitement, to which he was
      at present unable to give a name. Rallying himself, however, he glanced up
      and down the board smilingly, lifting his glass to salute Sergius Thord,
      who responded from his place at the bottom of the table,&mdash;and very
      soon he regained his usual placidity, for he had enormous strength of
      will, and kept an almost despotic tyranny over his feelings. His
      companions, Max Graub and Axel Regor, were separated from him, and from
      each other, at different sides of the table, and Paul Zouche the poet, was
      almost immediately opposite to him. He was glad to see that he was next
      but one to Lotys&mdash;the man between them being a desperado-looking
      fellow with a fierce moustache, and exceedingly gentle eyes,&mdash;who, as
      he afterwards discovered, was one of the greatest violinists in the world,&mdash;the
      favourite of kings and Courts,&mdash;and yet for all that, a prominent
      member of the Revolutionary Committee. The supper, which was of a simple,
      almost frugal character, was soon served, and the landlord, in setting the
      first plate before Lotys, laid beside it a knot of deep crimson roses, as
      an offering of homage and obedience from himself. She thanked him with a
      smile and glance, and taking up the flowers, fastened them at her breast.
      Conversation now became animated and general; and one of the men present,
      a delicate-looking young fellow, with a head resembling somewhat that of
      Keats, started a discussion by saying suddenly&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Jost has sold out all his shares in that new mine that was started the
      other day. It looks as if he did not think, after all his newspaper puffs,
      that the thing was going to work."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If Jost has sold, Pérousse will," said his neighbour; "The two are
      concerned together in the floating of the whole business."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And yet another piece of news!" put in Paul Zouche suddenly; "For if we
      talk of stocks and shares, we talk of money! What think you, my friends!
      I, Paul Zouche, have been offered payment for my poems! This very
      afternoon! Imagine! Will not the spheres fall? A poet to be paid for his
      poems is as though one should offer the Creator a pecuniary consideration
      for creating the flowers!"
    </p>
    <p>
      His face was flushed, and his eyes deliriously bright.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Listen, my Sergius!" he said; "Wonders never cease in this world; but
      this is the most wonderful of all wonders! Out of the merest mischief and
      monkeyish malice, the other day I sent my latest book of poems to the King&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Shame! shame!" interrupted a dozen voices. "Against the rules, Paul! You
      have broken the bond!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Paul Zouche laughed loudly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How you yell, my baboons!" he cried; "How you screech about the rules of
      your lair! Wait till you hear! You surely do not suppose I sent the book
      out of any humility or loyalty, or desire for notice, do you? I sent it
      out of pure hate and scorn, to show him as a fool-Majesty, that there was
      something he could not do&mdash;something that should last when <i>he</i>
      was forgotten!&mdash;a few burning lines that should, like vitriol, eat
      into his Throne and outlast it! I sent it some days ago, and got an
      acknowledgment from the flunkey who writes Majesty's letters. But this
      afternoon I received a much more important document,&mdash;a letter from
      Eugène Silvano, secretary to our very honourable and trustworthy Premier!
      He informs me in set terms, that his Majesty the King has been pleased to
      appreciate my work as a poet, to the extent of offering me a hundred
      golden pieces a year for the term of my natural life! Ha-ha! A hundred
      golden pieces a year! And thus they would fasten this wild bird of
      Revolutionary song to a Royal cage, for a bit of sugar! A hundred golden
      pieces a year! It means food and lodging&mdash;warm blankets to sleep in&mdash;but
      it means something else,&mdash;loss of independence!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then you will not accept it?" said Pasquin Leroy, looking at him with
      interest over the rim of the glass from which he was just sipping his
      wine.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Accept it! I have already refused it! By swift return of post!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Shouts of "Bravo! bravo!" echoed around him on all sides; men sprang up
      and shook hands with him and patted him on the back, and even over the
      dark face of Sergius Thord there passed a bright illumining smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Zouche, with all thy faults, thou art a brave man!" said the young man
      with the Keats-like head, who was in reality confidential clerk to one of
      the largest stockbrokers in the metropolis; "A thousand times better to
      starve, than to accept Royal alms!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "To your health, Zouche!" said Lotys, leaning forward, glass in hand.
      "Your refusal of the King's offered bounty is a greater tragedy than any
      you have ever tried to write!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hear her!" cried Zouche, exultant; "She knows exactly how to put it! For
      look you, there are the true elements of tragedy in a worn coat and scant
      food, while the thoughts that help nations to live or die are burning in
      one's brain! Then comes a King with a handful of gold&mdash;and gold would
      be useful&mdash;it always is! But&mdash;by Heaven! to pay a poet for his
      poems is, as I said before, as if one were to meet the Deity on His way
      through space, scattering planets and solar systems at a touch, and then
      to say&mdash;'Well done, God! We shall remunerate You for your creative
      power as long as You shall last&mdash;so much per aeon!'"
    </p>
    <p>
      Leroy laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You wild soul!" he said; "Would you starve then, rather than accept a
      king's bounty?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I would!" answered Paul. "Look you, my brave Pasquin! Read back over all
      the centuries, and see the way in which these puppets we call kings have
      rewarded the greatest thinkers of their times! Is it anywhere recorded
      that the antique virgin, Elizabeth of England, ever did anything for
      Shakespeare? True&mdash;he might have been 'graciously permitted' to act
      one of his sublime tragedies before her&mdash;by Heaven!&mdash;she was
      only fit to be his scrubbing woman, by intellectual comparison! Kings and
      Queens have always trembled in their shoes, and on their thrones, before
      the might of the pen!&mdash;and it is natural therefore that they should
      ignore it as much as conveniently possible. A general, whose military
      tactics succeed in killing a hundred thousand innocent men receives a
      peerage and a hundred thousand a year,&mdash;a speculator who snatches
      territory and turns it into stock-jobbing material, is called an 'Empire
      Builder'; but the man whose Thought destroys or moulds a new World, and
      raises up a new Civilization, is considered beneath a crowned Majesty's
      consideration! 'Beneath,' by Heaven!&mdash;I, Paul Zouche, may yet mount
      behind Majesty's chair, and with a single rhyme send his crown spinning
      into space! Meanwhile, I have flung back his hundred golden pieces, with
      as much force in the edge of my pen as there would be in my hand if <i>you</i>
      were his Majesty sitting there, and I flung them across the table now!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Again Leroy laughed. His eyes flashed, but there was a certain regret and
      wistfulness in them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You approve, of course?" he said, turning to Sergius Thord.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sergius looked for a moment at Zouche with an infinitely grave and kindly
      compassion.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think Paul has acted bravely;" he then said slowly; "He has been true
      to the principles of our Order. And under the circumstances, it must have
      been difficult for him to refuse what would have been a certain
      competence,&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not difficult, Sergius!" exclaimed Zouche, "But purely triumphant!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Thord smiled,&mdash;then went on&mdash;"You see, my friend," and he
      addressed himself now to Leroy; "Kings have scorned the power of the pen
      too long! Those who possess that power are now taking vengeance for
      neglect. Thousands of pens all over the world to-day are digging the grave
      of Royalty, and building up the throne of Democracy. Who is to blame?
      Royalty itself is to blame, for deliberately passing over the claims of
      art and intellect, and giving preference to the claims of money. The
      moneyed man is ever the friend of Majesty,&mdash;but the brilliant man of
      letters is left out in the cold. Yet it is the man of letters who
      chronicles the age, and who will do so, we may be sure, according to his
      own experience. As the King treats the essayist, the romancist or the
      historian, so will these recording scribes treat the King!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is possible, though," suggested Leroy, "that the King meant well in
      his offer to our friend Zouche?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quite possible!" agreed Thord; "Only his offer of one hundred gold pieces
      a year to a man of intellect, is out of all proportion to the salary he
      pays his cook!"
    </p>
    <p>
      A slight flush reddened Leroy's bronzed cheek. Thord observed him
      attentively, and saw that his soul was absorbed by some deep-seated
      intellectual irritation. He began to feel strangely drawn towards him; his
      eyes questioned the secret which he appeared to hold in his mind, but the
      quiet composure of the man's handsome face baffled enquiry. Meanwhile
      around the table the conversation grew louder and less restrained. The
      young stockbroker's clerk was holding forth eloquently concerning the many
      occasions on which he had seen Carl Pérousse at his employer's office,
      carefully going into the closest questions of financial losses or gains
      likely to result from certain political moves,&mdash;and he remembered one
      day in particular, when, after purchasing a hundred thousand shares in a
      certain company, Pérousse had turned suddenly round on his broker with the
      cool remark&mdash;"If ever you breathe a whisper about this transaction, I
      will shoot you dead!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Whereat the broker had replied that it was not his custom to give away his
      clients' business, and that threats were unworthy of a statesman. Then
      Pérousse had become as friendly as he had been before menacing; and the
      two had gone out of the office and lunched together. And the confidential
      clerk thus chattering his news, declared that his employer was now
      evidently uneasy; and that from that uneasiness he augured a sudden
      fluctuation or fall in what had lately seemed the most valuable stock in
      the market.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you? Your news, Valdor," cried one or two eager voices, while several
      heads leaned forward in the direction of the fiercely-moustached man who
      sat next to Lotys. "Where have you been with your fiddle? Do you arrive
      among us to-night infected by the pay, or the purple of Royalty?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Louis Valdor, by birth a Norseman, and by sympathies a cosmopolitan,
      looked up with a satiric smile in his dark eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is no purple left to infect a man with, in the modern slum of
      Royalty!" he said; "Tobacco-smoke, not incense, perfumes the palaces of
      the great nowadays&mdash;and card-playing is more appreciated than music!
      Yet I and my fiddle have made many long journeys lately,&mdash;and we have
      sent our messages of Heaven thrilling through the callous horrors of Hell!
      A few nights since, I played at the Russian Court&mdash;before the
      beautiful Empress&mdash;cold as a stone&mdash;with her great diamonds
      flashing on her unhappy breast,&mdash;before the Emperor, whose furtive
      eyes gazed unseeingly before him, as though black Fate hovered in the air&mdash;before
      women, whose lives are steeped in the lowest intrigue&mdash;before men,
      whose faces are as bearded masks, covering the wolf's snarl,&mdash;yes!&mdash;I
      played before these,&mdash;played with all the chords of my heart
      vibrating to the violin, till at last a human sigh quivered from the lips
      of the statuesque Empress,&mdash;till a frown crossed the brooding brow of
      her spouse&mdash;till the intriguing women shook off the spell with a
      laugh, and the men did the same with an oath&mdash;and I was satisfied! I
      received neither 'pay,' nor jewel of recognition,&mdash;I had played 'for
      the honour' of appearing before their Majesties!&mdash;but my bow was a
      wand to wake the little poisoned asp of despair that stings its way into
      the heart under every Royal mantle of ermine, and that sufficed me!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sometimes," said Leroy, turning towards him; "I pity kings!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I' faith, so do I!" returned Valdor. "But only sometimes! And if you had
      seen as much of them as I have, the 'sometimes' would be rare!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yet you play before them?" put in Max Graub.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because I must do so to satisfy the impresarios who advertise me to the
      public," said Valdor. "Alas!&mdash;why will the public be so foolish as to
      wish their favourite artist to play before kings and queens? Seldom, if
      ever, do these Royal people understand music,&mdash;still less do they
      understand the musician! Believe me, I have been treated as the veriest
      scullion by these jacks-in-office; and that I still permit myself to play
      before them is a duty I owe to this Brotherhood,&mdash;because it deepens
      and sustains my bond with you all. There is no king on the face of the
      earth who has dignity and nobleness of character enough to command my
      respect,&mdash;much less my reverence! I take nothing from kings,
      remember!&mdash;they dare not offer me money&mdash;they dare not insult me
      with a jewelled pin, such as they would give to a station-master who sees
      a Royal train off. Only the other day, when I was summoned to play before
      a certain Majesty, a lord-in-waiting addressed me when I arrived with the
      insolent words&mdash;'You are late, Monsieur Valdor!&mdash;You have kept
      the King waiting!' I replied&mdash;'Is that so? I regret it! But having
      kept his Majesty waiting, I will no longer detain him; au revoir!' And I
      returned straightway to the carriage in which I had come. Majesty did
      without his music that evening, owing to the insolence of his flunkey-man!
      Whether I ever play before him again or not, is absolutely immaterial to
      me!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tell me," said Pasquin Leroy, pushing the flask of wine over to him as he
      spoke; "What is it that makes kings so unloved? I hate them myself!&mdash;but
      let us analyse the reasons why."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Discuss&mdash;discuss!" cried Paul Zouche; "Why are kings hated? Let
      Thord answer first!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes&mdash;yes! Let Thord answer first!" was echoed a dozen times.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thord, thus appealed to, looked up. His melancholy deep eyes were sombre,
      yet full of fire,&mdash;lonely eyes they were, yearning for love.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why are kings hated?" he repeated; "Because today they are the effete
      representatives of an effete system. I can quite imagine that if, as in
      olden times, kings had maintained a position of personal bravery, and
      personal influence on their subjects, they would have been as much beloved
      as they are now despised. But what we have to see and to recognise is
      this: in one land we hear of a sovereign who speculates hand-and-glove
      with low-born Jew contractors and tradesmen,&mdash;another monarch makes
      no secret of his desire to profit financially out of a gambling hell
      started in his dominions,&mdash;another makes his domestic affairs the
      subject of newspaper comment,&mdash;another is always apostrophising the
      Almighty in public;&mdash;another is insane or stupid,&mdash;and so on
      through the whole gamut. Is it not natural that an intelligent People
      should resent the fact that their visibly governing head is a gambler, or
      a voluptuary? Myself, I think the growing unpopularity of kings is the
      result of their incapability for kingship."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now let me speak!" cried Paul Zouche excitedly; "There is another root to
      the matter,&mdash;a root like that of a certain tropical orchid, which
      according to superstition, is shaped like a man, and utters a shriek when
      it is pulled out of the earth! Pull out this screaming mystery,&mdash;hatred
      of kings! In the first place it is because they are hateful in themselves,&mdash;because
      they have been brought up and educated to take an immeasurable and
      all-absorbing interest in their own identity, rather than in the lives,
      hopes and aims of their subjects. In the second&mdash;as soon as they
      occupy thrones, they become overbearing to their best friends. It is a
      well-known fact that the more loyal and faithful you are to a king, the
      more completely is he neglectful of you! 'Put not your trust in princes,'
      sang old David. He knew how untrustworthy they were, being a king himself,
      and a pious one to boot! Thirdly and lastly,&mdash;they only give their
      own personal attention to their concubines, and leave all their honest and
      respectable subjects to be dealt with by servants and secretaries. Our
      King, for example, never smiles so graciously as on Madame Vantine, the
      wife of Vantine the wine-grower;&mdash;and he buys Vantine's wines as well
      as his wife, which brings in a double profit to the firm!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Leroy looked up.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you sure of that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Zouche met his eyes with a stare and a laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sure? Of course I am sure! By my faith, your resemblance to his Majesty
      is somewhat striking to-night, my bold Leroy! The same straight brows&mdash;the
      same inscrutable, woman-conquering smile! I studied his portrait after the
      offer of the hundred golden pieces&mdash;and I swear you might be his twin
      brother!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I told you so!" replied Leroy imperturbably;&mdash;"It is a hateful
      resemblance! I wish I could rid myself of it. Still after all, there is
      something unique in being countenanced like a King, and minded as a
      Socialist!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "True!" put in Thord gently;&mdash;"I am satisfied, Pasquin Leroy, that
      you are an honest comrade!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Leroy met his eyes with a grave smile, and touched his glass by way of
      acknowledgement.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You do not ask me," he said then, "whether I have been able to serve your
      Cause in any way since last we met?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "This is not our regular meeting," said Johan Zegota; "We ask no questions
      till the general monthly assembly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I see!" And Leroy looked whimsically meditative&mdash;"Still, as we are
      all friends and brothers here, there is no harm in conveying to you the
      fact that I have so far moved, in the appointed way, that Carl Pérousse
      has ordered the discovery and arrest of one Pasquin Leroy, supposed to be
      a spy on the military defences of the city!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Lotys gave a little cry.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not possible! So soon!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quite possible, Madame," said Leroy inclining his head towards her
      deferentially. "I have lost no time in doing my duty!" And his eyes
      flashed upon her with a passionate, half-eager questioning. "I must carry
      out my Chief's commands!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But you are in danger, then?" said Sergius Thord, bending an anxious look
      of enquiry upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not more so than you, or any of my comrades are," replied Leroy; "I have
      commenced my campaign&mdash;and I have no doubt you will hear some results
      of it ere long!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He spoke so quietly and firmly, yet with such an air of assurance and
      authority, that something of an electric thrill passed through the entire
      company, and all eyes were fixed on him in mingled admiration and
      wonderment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of the 'Corruption of the State,' concerning which our fair teacher has
      spoken to-night," he continued, with another quick glance at Lotys&mdash;"there
      can be no manner of doubt. But we should, I think, say the 'Corruption of
      the Ministry' rather than of the State. It is not because a few
      stock-jobbers rule the Press and the Cabinet, that the State is
      necessarily corrupt. Remove the corruptors,&mdash;sweep the dirt from the
      house&mdash;and the State will be clean."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It will require a very long broom!" said Paul Zouche. "Take David Jost,
      for example,&mdash;he is the fat Jew-spider of several newspaper webs,&mdash;and
      to sweep him out is not so easy. His printed sheets are read by the
      million; and the million are deluded into believing him a reliable
      authority!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing so easy as to prove him unreliable," said Leroy composedly; "And
      then&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then the million will continue to read his journals out of sheer
      curiosity, to see how long a liar can go on lying!" said Zouche;&mdash;"Besides
      a Jew can turn his coat a dozen times a day; he has inherited Joseph's
      'coat of many colours' to suit many opinions. At present Jost supports
      Pérousse, and calls him the greatest statesman living; but if Pérousse
      were once proved a fraud, Jost would pen a sublimely-conscientious leading
      article, beginning in this strain;&mdash;' We are now at liberty to
      confess that we always had our doubts of M. Pérousse!'"
    </p>
    <p>
      A murmur of angry laughter went round the board.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There was an article this evening in one of Jost's off-shoot journals,"
      went on Zouche, "which must have been paid for at a considerable cost. It
      chanted the praises of one Monsignor Del Fortis,&mdash;who, it appears,
      preached a sermon on 'National Education' the other day, and told all the
      sleepy, yawning people how necessary it was to have Roman Catholic schools
      in every town and village, in order that souls might be saved. The article
      ended by saying&mdash;'We hear on good authority that his Majesty the King
      has been pleased to grant a considerable portion of certain Crown lands to
      the Jesuit Order, for the necessary building of a monastery and schools'&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is a lie!" broke in Pasquin Leroy, with sudden vehemence. "The King
      is in many respects a scoundrel, but he does not go back on his word!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Axel Regor looked fixedly across at him, with a warning flash in the light
      of his cold languid eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But how do you know that the King has given his word?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was in the paper," said Leroy, more guardedly; "I was reading about
      it, as you know, on the very night I encountered Thord."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah! But you must recollect, my friend, that a statement in the papers is
      never true nowadays!" said Max Graub, with a laugh; "Whenever I read
      anything in the newspaper, unless it is an official telegram, I know it is
      a lie; and even official telegrams have been known to emanate from
      unofficial sources!"
    </p>
    <p>
      By this time supper was nearly over, and the landlord, clearing the
      remains of the heavier fare, set fruit and wine on the board. Sergius
      Thord filled his glass, and made a sign to his companions to do the same.
      Then he stood up.
    </p>
    <p>
      "To Lotys!" he said, his fine eyes darkening with the passion of his
      thought. "To Lotys, who inspires our best work, and helps us to retain our
      noblest ideals!"
    </p>
    <p>
      All present sprang to their feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      "To Lotys!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Pasquin Leroy fixed a straight glance on the subject of the toast, sitting
      quietly at the head of the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      "To Lotys!" he repeated; "And may she always be as merciful as she is
      strong!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She lifted her dark-blue slumbrous eyes, and met his keen scrutinizing
      look. A very slight tremulous smile flickered across her lips. She
      inclined her head gently, and in the same mute fashion thanked them all.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Play to us, Valdor!" she then said; "And so make answer for me to our
      friends' good wishes!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Valdor dived under the table, and brought up his violin case, which he
      unlocked with jealous tenderness, lifting his instrument as carefully as
      though it were a sleeping child whom he feared to wake. Drawing the bow
      across the strings, he invoked a sweet plaintive sound, like the first
      sigh of the wind among the trees; then, without further preliminary
      wandered off into a strange labyrinth of melody, wherein it seemed that
      the voices of women and angels clamoured one against the other,&mdash;the
      appeals of earth with the refusals of Heaven,&mdash;the loneliness of life
      with the fulness of immortality,&mdash;so, rising, falling, sobbing,
      praying, alternately, the music expostulated with humanity in its
      throbbing chords, till it seemed as if some Divine interposition could
      alone end the heart-searching argument. Every man sat motionless and mute,
      listening; Paul Zouche, with his head thrown back and eyes closed as in a
      dream,&mdash;Johan Zegota's hard, plain and careworn face growing softer
      and quieter in its expression,&mdash;while Sergius Thord, leaning on one
      elbow, covered his brow with one hand to shade the lines of sorrow there.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Valdor ceased playing, there was a burst of applause.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You play before kings,&mdash;kings should be proud to hear you!" said
      Leroy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah! So they should," responded Valdor promptly; "Only it happens that
      they are not! They treat me merely as a <i>laquais de place</i>,&mdash;just
      as they would treat Zouche, had he accepted his Sovereign's offer. But
      this I will admit,&mdash;that mediocre musicians always get on very well
      with Royal persons! I have heard a very great Majesty indeed praise a
      common little American woman's abominable singing, as though she were a
      prima-donna, and saw him give a jewelled cigar-case to an amateur pianist,
      whose fingers rattled on the keyboard like bones on a tom-tom. But then
      the common little American woman invited his Majesty's 'chères amies' to
      her house; and the amateur pianist was content to lose money to him at
      cards! Wheels within wheels, my friend! In a lesser degree the
      stock-jobber who sets a little extra cash rolling on the Exchange is
      called an 'Empire Builder.' It is a curious world! But kings were never
      known to be 'proud' of any really 'great' men in either art or literature;
      on the contrary, they were always afraid of them, and always will be!
      Among musicians, the only one who ever got decently honoured by a monarch
      was Richard Wagner,&mdash;and the world swears that <i>his</i> Royal
      patron was mad!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Paul Zouche opened his eyes, filled his glass afresh, and tossed down the
      liquor it contained at a gulp.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Before we have any more music," he said, "and before the little Pequita
      gives us the dance which she has promised,&mdash;not to us, but to Lotys&mdash;we
      ought to have prayers!"
    </p>
    <p>
      A loud laugh answered this strange proposition.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I say we ought to have prayers!" repeated Zouche with semi-solemn
      earnestness,&mdash;"You talk of news,&mdash;news in telegram,&mdash;news
      in brief,&mdash;official scratchings for the day and hour,&mdash;and do
      you take no thought for the fact that his Holiness the Pope is ill&mdash;perhaps
      dying?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He stared wildly round upon them all; and a tolerant smile passed over the
      face of the company.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, if that be so, Paul," said a man next to him, "it is not to be
      wondered at. The Pope has arrived at a great age!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No age at all!&mdash;no age at all!" declared Zouche. "A saint of God
      should live longer than a pauper! What of the good old lady admitted to
      hospital the other day whose birth certificate proved her beyond doubt to
      be one hundred and twenty-one years old? The dear creature had not
      married;&mdash;nor has his Holiness the Pope,&mdash;the real cause of
      death is in neither of them! Why should he not live as long as his aged
      sister, possessing, as he does the keys of Heaven? He need not unlock the
      little golden door, even for himself, unless he likes. That is true
      orthodoxy! Pasquin Leroy, you bold imitation of a king, more wine!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Leroy filled the glass he held out to him. The glances of the company told
      him Zouche was 'on,' and that it was no good trying to stem the flow of
      his ideas, or check the inconsequential nature of his speech. Lotys had
      moved her chair a little back from the table, and with both arms
      encircling the child, Pequita, was talking to her in low and tender tones.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Brethren, let us pray!" cried Zouche; "For all we know, while we sit here
      carousing and drinking to the health of our incomparable Lotys, the soul
      of St. Peter's successor may be careering through Sphere-Forests, and over
      Planet-Oceans, up to its own specially built and particularly furnished
      Heaven! There is only one Heaven, as we all know,&mdash;and the space is
      limited, as it only holds the followers of St. Peter, the good disciple
      who denied Christ!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is an exploded creed, Zouche," said Thord quietly; "No man of any
      sense or reason believes such childish nonsense nowadays! The most casual
      student of astronomy knows better."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Astronomy! Fie, for shame!" And Zouche gave a mock-solemn shake of the
      head; "A wicked science! A great heresy! What are God's Facts to the
      Church Fallacies? Science proves that there are millions and millions of
      solar systems,&mdash;millions and millions of worlds, no doubt inhabited;&mdash;yet
      the Church teaches that there is only one Heaven, specially reserved for
      good Roman Catholics; and that St. Peter and his successors keep the keys
      of it. God,&mdash;the Deity&mdash;the Creator,&mdash;the Supreme Being,
      has evidently nothing at all to do with it. In fact, He is probably
      outside it! And of a surety Christ, with His ideas of honesty and
      equality, could never possibly get into it!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "There you are right!" said Valdor; "Your words remind me of a
      conversation I overheard once between a great writer of books and a
      certain Prince of the blood Royal. 'Life is a difficult problem!' said the
      Prince, smoking a fat cigar. 'To the student, it is, Sir,' replied the
      author; 'But to the sensualist, it is no more than the mud-stye of the
      swine,&mdash;he noses the refuse and is happy! He has no need of the
      Higher life, and plainly the Higher life has no need of him. Of course,'
      he added with covert satire, 'your Highness believes in a Higher life?'
      'Of course, of course!' responded the Royal creature, unconscious of any
      veiled sarcasm; 'We must be Christians before anything!' And that same
      evening this hypocritical Highness 'rooked' a foolish young fellow of over
      one thousand English pounds!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perfectly natural!" said Zouche. "The fashionable estimate of
      Christianity is to go to church o' Sundays, and say 'I believe in God,'
      and to cheat at cards on all the other days of the week, as active
      testimony to a stronger faith in the devil!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And with it all, Zouche," said Lotys suddenly; "There is more good in
      humanity than is apparent."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And more bad, beloved Lotys," returned Paul. "Tout le deux se disent! But
      let us think of the Holy Father!&mdash;he who, after long years of patient
      and sublime credulity, is now, for all we know, bracing himself to take
      the inevitable plunge into the dark waters of Eternity! Poor frail old
      man! Who would not pity him! His earthly home has been so small and cosy
      and restricted,&mdash;he has been taken such tender care of&mdash;the
      faithful have fallen at his feet in such adoring thousands,&mdash;and now&mdash;away
      from all this warmth and light and incense, and colour of pictures and
      stained-glass windows, and white statuary and purple velvets, and
      golden-fringed palanquins,&mdash;now&mdash;out into the cold he must go!&mdash;out
      into the darkness and mystery and silence!&mdash;where all the former
      generations of the world, immense and endless, and all the old religions,
      are huddled away in the mist of the mouldered past!&mdash;out into the
      thick blackness, where maybe the fiery heads of Bel and the Dragon may
      lift themselves upward and leer at him!&mdash;or he may meet the frightful
      menace of some monstrous Mexican deity, once worshipped with the rites of
      blood!&mdash;out&mdash;out into the unknown, unimaginable Amazement must
      the poor naked Soul go shuddering on the blast of death, to face he truly
      knows not what!&mdash;but possibly he has such a pitiful blind trust in
      good, that he may be re-transformed into some pleasant living
      consciousness that shall be more agreeable even than that of Pope of Rome!
      'Mourir c'est rien,&mdash;mais souffrir!' That is the hard part of it! Let
      us all pray for the Pope, my friends!&mdash;he is an old man!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "When you are silent, Zouche," said Thord with a half smile; "We may
      perhaps meditate upon him in our thoughts,&mdash;but not while you talk
      thus volubly! You take up time&mdash;and Pequita is getting tired."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," said Lotys; "Pequita and I will go home, and there will be no
      dancing to-night."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, Lotys! You will not be so cruel!" said Zouche, pushing his grey hair
      back from his brows, while his wild eyes glittered under the tangle, like
      the eyes of a beast in its lair; "Think for a moment! I do not come here
      and bore you with my poems, though I might very well do so! Some of them
      are worth hearing, I assure you;&mdash;even the King&mdash;curse him!&mdash;has
      condescended to think so, or else why should he offer me pay for them?
      Kings are not so ready to part with money, even when it is Government
      money! In England once a Premier named Gladstone, gave two hundred and
      fifty pounds a year pension to the French Prince, Lucien Buonaparte, 'for
      his researches into Celtic literature'! Bah! There were many worthier
      native-born men who had worked harder on the same subject, to choose from,&mdash;without
      giving good English money to a Frenchman! There is a case of your Order
      and Justice, Lotys! You spoke to-night of these two impossible things. Why
      will you touch on such subjects? You know there is no Order and no Justice
      anywhere! The Universe is a chance whirl of gas and atoms; though where
      the two mischiefs come from nobody knows! And why the devil we should be
      made the prey of gas and atoms is a mystery which no Church can solve!"
    </p>
    <p>
      As he said this, there was a slight movement of every head towards Lotys,
      and enquiring eyes looked suggestively at her. She saw the look, and
      responded to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are wrong, Zouche!&mdash;I have always told you you are wrong," she
      said emphatically, "It is in your own disordered thoughts that you see no
      justice and no order,&mdash;but Order there is, and Justice there is,&mdash;and
      Compensation for all that seems to go wrong. There is an Intelligence at
      the core of Creation! It is not for us to measure that Intelligence, or to
      set any limits to it. Our duty is to recognize it, and to set ourselves as
      much as possible in harmony with it. Do you never, in sane moments, study
      the progress of humanity? Do you not see that while the brute creation
      remains stationary, (some specimens of it even becoming extinct), man goes
      step by step to higher results? This is, or should be, sufficient proof
      that death is not the end for us. This world is only one link in our chain
      of intended experience. I think it depends on ourselves as to what we make
      of it. Thought is a great power by which we mould ourselves and others;
      and we have no right to subvert that power to base uses, or to poison it
      by distrust of good, or disbelief in the Supreme Guidance. You would be a
      thousand times better as a man, Zouche, and far greater as a poet, if you
      could believe in God!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She spoke with eloquence and affectionate earnestness, and among all the
      men there was a moment's silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, <i>you</i> believe in Him;" said Zouche at last, "and I will catch
      hold of your angel's robe as you pass into His Presence and say to Him;&mdash;'
      Here comes poor Zouche, who wrote of beautiful things among ugly
      surroundings, and who, in order to be true to his friends, chose poverty
      rather than the gold of a king!'"
    </p>
    <p>
      Lotys smiled, very sweetly and indulgently.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Such a plea would stand you in good stead, Zouche! To be always true to
      one's friends, and to persistently believe in beauty, is a very long step
      towards Heaven!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I did not say I <i>believed</i> in beauty," said Zouche suddenly and
      obstinately;&mdash;"I dream it&mdash;I think it&mdash;but I do not see it!
      To me the world is one Horror&mdash;nothing but a Grave into which we all
      must fall! The fairest face has a hideous skull behind it,&mdash;the
      dazzling blue of the sea covers devouring monsters in its depths&mdash;the
      green fields, the lovely woodlands, are full of vile worms and noxious
      beetles,&mdash;and space itself swarms with thick-strewn worlds,&mdash;flaming
      comets,&mdash;blazing nebulae,&mdash;among which our earth is but a gnat's
      wing in a huge flame! Horrible!&mdash;horrible!" And he spoke with a kind
      of vehement fury. "Let us not think of it! Why should we insist on Truth?
      Let us have lies!&mdash;dear, sweet lies and fond delusions! Let us
      believe that men are all honest, and women all loving!&mdash;that there
      are virgins and saints and angels, as well as bishops and curates, looking
      after us in this wild world of terror,&mdash;oh, yes!&mdash;let us
      believe!&mdash;better the Pope's little private snuggery of a Heaven, than
      the crushing truth which says 'Our God is a consuming fire'! Knowledge
      deepens sorrow,&mdash;truth kills!&mdash;we must&mdash;we must have a
      little love, and a few lies to lean upon!"
    </p>
    <p>
      His voice faltered,&mdash;and a sudden ashy paleness overspread his
      features,&mdash;his head fell back helplessly, and he seemed transfixed
      and insensible. Leroy and one or two of the others rose in alarm, thinking
      he had swooned, but Sergius Thord warned them back by a sign. The little
      Pequita, slipping from the arms of Lotys, went softly up to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Paul! Dear Paul!" she said in her soft childish tones.
    </p>
    <p>
      Zouche stirred, and stretching out one hand, groped with it blindly in the
      air. Pequita took it, warming it between her own little palms.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Paul!" she said; "Do wake up! You have been asleep such a long time!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He opened his eyes. The grey pallor passed from his face; he lifted his
      head and smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So! There you are, Pequita!" he said gently; "Dear little one! So brave
      and cheerful in your hard life!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He lifted her small brown hand, and kissed it. The feverish tension of his
      brain relaxed,&mdash;and two large tears welled up in his eyes, and rolled
      down his cheeks. "Poor little girl!" he murmured weakly; "Poor little
      hard-working girl!"
    </p>
    <p>
      All the men sat silent, watching the gradual softening of Zouche's drunken
      delirium by the mere gentle caress of the child; and Pasquin Leroy was
      conscious of a curious tightening of the muscles of his throat, and a
      straining compassion at his heart, which was more like acute sympathy with
      the griefs and sins of humanity than any emotion he had ever known. He saw
      that the thoughtful, pitiful eyes of Lotys were full of tears, and he
      longed, in quite a foolish, almost boyish fashion, to take her in his arms
      and by a whispered word of tenderness, persuade those tears away. Yet he
      was a man of the world, and had seen and known enough. But had he known
      them humanly? Or only from the usual standpoint of masculine egotism? As
      he thought this, a strain of sweet and solemn music stole through the
      room,&mdash;Louis Valdor had risen to his feet, and holding the violin
      tenderly against his heart, was coaxing out of its wooden cavity a
      plaintive request for sympathy and attention. Such delicious music
      thrilled upon the dead silence as might have fitted Shelley's exquisite
      lines.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   "There the voluptuous nightingales,
      Are awake through all the broad noon-day,
  When one with bliss or sadness fails,
      And through the windless ivy-boughs
  Sick with sweet love, droops dying away
      On its mate's music-panting bosom;
      Another from the swinging blossom,
  Watching to catch the languid close
      Of the last strain; then lifts on high
      The wings of the weak melody,
  Till some new strain of feeling bear
      The song, and all the woods are mute;
  When there is heard through the dim air
  The rush of wings, and rising there
      Like many a lake-surrounded flute
  Sounds overflow the listener's brain,
  So sweet that joy is almost pain."
</pre>
    <p>
      "Thank God for music!" said Sergius Thord, as Valdor laid aside his bow;
      "It exorcises the evil spirit from every modern Saul!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sometimes!" responded Valdor; "But I have known cases where the evil
      spirit has been roused by music instead of suppressed. Art, like virtue,
      has two sides!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Zouche was still holding Pequita's hand. He looked ill and exhausted, like
      a man who had passed through a violent paroxysm of fever.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are a good child, Pequita!" he was saying softly; "Try to be always
      so!&mdash;it is difficult&mdash;but it is easier to a woman than to a man!
      Women have more of good in them than men!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "How about the dance?" suggested Thord; "The hour is late,&mdash;close on
      midnight&mdash;and Lotys must be tired."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Shall I dance now?" enquired Pequita.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lotys smiled and nodded. Four or five of the company at once got up, and
      helped to push aside the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will you play for me, Monsieur Valdor?" asked the little girl, still
      standing by the side of Zouche.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course, my child! What shall it be? Something to suggest a fairy
      hopping over mushrooms in the moonlight?&mdash;or Shakespeare's Ariel
      swinging on a cobweb from a bunch of may?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Pequita considered, and for a moment did not reply, while Zouche, still
      holding her little brown hand, kissed it again.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are very fond of dancing?" asked Pasquin Leroy, looking at her dark
      face and big black eyes with increasing interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      She smiled frankly at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes! I would like to dance before the King!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Fie, fie, Pequita!" cried Johan Zegota, while murmurs of laughter and
      playful cries of 'Shame, Shame' echoed through the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why not?" said Pequita; "It would do me good, and my father too! Such
      poor, sad people come to the theatre where I dance,&mdash;they love to see
      me, and I love to dance for them&mdash;but then&mdash;they too would be
      pleased if I could dance at the Royal Opera, because they would know I
      could then earn enough money to make my father comfortable."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What a very matter-of-fact statement in favour of kings!" exclaimed Max
      Graub;&mdash;"Here is a child who does not care a button for a king as
      king; but she thinks he would be useful as a figure-head to dance to,&mdash;for
      idiotic Fashion, grouping itself idiotically around the figure-head, would
      want to see her dance also&mdash;and then&mdash;oh simple conclusion!&mdash;she
      would be able to support her father! Truly, a king has often been put to
      worse uses!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think," said Pasquin Leroy, "I could manage to get you a trial at the
      Royal Opera, Pequita! I know the manager."
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked up with a sudden blaze of light in her eyes, sprang towards
      him, dropped on one knee with an exquisite grace, and kissed his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh!&mdash;you will be goodness itself!" she cried;&mdash;"And I will be
      grateful&mdash;indeed I will!&mdash;so grateful!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He was startled and amazed at her impulsive action, and taking her little
      hand, gently pressed it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Poor child!" he said;&mdash;"You must not thank me till I succeed. It is
      very little to do&mdash;but I will do all I can."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Someone else will be grateful too!" said Lotys in her rich thrilling
      voice; and her eyes rested on him with that wonderful magnetic sweetness
      which drew his soul out of him as by a spell; while Zouche, only partially
      understanding the conversation said slowly:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pequita deserves all the good she can get; more than any of us. We do
      nothing but try to support ourselves; and we talk a vast amount about
      supporting others,&mdash;but Pequita works all the time and says nothing.
      And she is a genius&mdash;she does not know it, but she is. Give us the
      Dagger Dance, Pequita! Then our friend Leroy can judge of you at your
      best, and make good report of you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Pequita looked at Lotys and received a sign of assent. She then nodded to
      Valdor.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You know what to play?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Valdor nodded in return, and took up his violin. The company drew back
      their seats, and sat, or stood aside, from the centre of the room. Pequita
      disappeared for a moment, and returned divested of the plain rusty black
      frock she had worn, and merely clad in a short scarlet petticoat, with a
      low white calico bodice&mdash;her dark curls tumbling in disorder, and
      grasping in her right hand a brightly polished, unsheathed dagger. Valdor
      began to play, and with the first wild chords the childish figure swayed,
      circled, and leaped forward like a young Amazon, the dagger brandished
      aloft, and gleaming here and there as though it were a snaky twist of
      lightning. Very soon Pasquin Leroy found himself watching the evolutions
      of the girl dancer with fascinated interest. Nothing so light, so delicate
      or so graceful had he ever seen as this little slight form bending to and
      fro, now gliding with the grace of a swan on water&mdash;now leaping
      swiftly as a fawn,&mdash;while the attitudes she threw herself into,
      sometimes threatening, sometimes defiant, and often commanding, with the
      glittering steel weapon held firmly in her tiny hand, were each and all
      pictures of youthful pliancy and animation. As she swung and whirled,&mdash;sometimes
      pirouetting so swiftly that her scarlet skirt looked like a mere red
      flower in the wind,&mdash;her bright eyes flashed, her dark hair tangled
      itself in still richer masses, and her lips, crimson as the pomegranate,
      were half parted with her panting breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Brava! Brava!" shouted the men, becoming more and more excited as their
      eyes followed the flash of the dagger she held, now directed towards them,
      now shaken aloft, and again waved threateningly from side to side, or
      pointed at her own bosom, while her little feet twinkled over the floor in
      a maze of intricate and perfectly performed steps;&mdash;and "Brava!"
      cried Pasquin Leroy, as breathless, but still glowing and bright with her
      exertions, she suddenly out of her own impulse, dropped on one knee before
      him with the glittering dagger pointed straight at his heart!
    </p>
    <p>
      "Would that please the King?" she asked, her pearly teeth gleaming into a
      mischievous smile between the red lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If it did not, he would be a worse fool than even I take him for!"
      replied Leroy, as she sprang up again, and confronted him. "Here is a
      little souvenir from me, child!&mdash;and if ever you do dance before his
      Majesty, wear it for my sake!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He took from his pocket a ring, in which was set a fine brilliant of
      unusual size and lustre.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked at it a moment as he held it out to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, no," she faltered, "I cannot take it&mdash;I cannot! Lotys dear, you
      know I cannot!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Lotys, thus appealed to, left her seat and came forward. Taking the ring
      from Leroy's hand, she examined it a moment, then gently returned it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This is too great a temptation for Pequita, my friend," she said quietly,
      but firmly. "In duty bound, she would have to sell it in order to help her
      poor father. She could not justly keep it. Let me be the arbiter in this
      matter. If you can carry out your suggestion, and obtain for her an
      engagement at the Royal Opera, then give it to her, but not till then! Do
      you not think I am right?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She spoke so sweetly and persuasively, that Leroy was profoundly touched.
      What he would have liked would have been to give the child a roll of gold
      pieces,&mdash;but he was playing a strange part, and the time to act
      openly was not yet.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It shall be as you wish, Madame!" he said with courteous deference.
      "Pequita, the first time you dance before the King, this shall be yours!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He put aside the jewel, and Pequita kissed his hand impulsively,&mdash;as
      impulsively she kissed the lips of her friend Lotys&mdash;and then came
      the general dispersal and break-up of the assembly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tell me;" said Sergius Thord, catching Leroy's hand in a close and
      friendly grasp ere bidding him farewell; "Are you in very truth in
      personal danger on account of serving our Cause?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No!" replied Leroy frankly, returning the warm pressure; "And rest
      assured that if I were, I would find means to elude it! I have managed to
      frighten Carl Pérousse, that is all&mdash;and Jost!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Jost!" echoed Sergius; "The Colossus of the Press? Surely it would take
      more than one man to frighten him!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Leroy laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I grant you the Jewish centres of journalism are difficult to shake! But
      they all depend on stocks and shares!"
    </p>
    <p>
      A touch on his arm caused him to turn round,&mdash;Paul Zouche confronted
      both him and Thord, with a solemn worn face, and lack-lustre eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good-night, friends!" he said; "I have not kicked at a king with my boot,
      but I have with my brain!&mdash;and the effort is exhausting! I am going
      home to bed."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where is your home?" asked Leroy suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Zouche looked mysterious.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In a palace, dear sir! A palace of golden air, peopled with winged
      dreams! No money could purchase it;&mdash;no 'Empire Builder' could build
      it!&mdash;it is mine and mine alone! And I pay no taxes!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will you put this to some use for me?" said Leroy, holding out a gold
      piece; "Simply as comrade and friend?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Zouche stared at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You mean it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course I mean it! Zouche, believe me, you are going to be the fashion!
      You will be able to do <i>me</i> a good turn before long!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Zouche took the gold piece, and as he took it, pressed the giver's hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You mean well!" he said tremulously; "You know&mdash;as Sergius does,
      that I am poor,&mdash;often starving&mdash;often drunk&mdash;but you know
      also that there is something <i>here</i>!"&mdash;and he touched his
      forehead meaningly. "But to be the 'fashion'! Bah! I do not belong to the
      Trade-ocracy! Nobody becomes the 'fashion' nowadays unless they have
      cheated their neighbours by short weight and falsified accounts!
      Good-night! You might be the King from your looks;&mdash;but you have
      something better than kingship&mdash;Heart! Good-night, Pequita! You
      danced well! Good-night, Lotys! You spoke well! Everyone does everything
      well, except poor Zouche!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Pequita ran up to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good-night, dear Paul!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He stooped and kissed her gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good-night, little one! If ever you show your twinkling feet at the
      Opera, <i>you</i> will be the 'fashion'&mdash;and will you remember Paul
      then?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Always&mdash;always!" said Pequita tenderly; "Father and Lotys and I will
      always love you!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Zouche gave a short laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Always love me! Me! Well!&mdash;what strange things children will say,
      not knowing in the least what they mean!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He gave a vague salute to the entire company, and walked out of the tavern
      with drooping head. Others followed him,&mdash;every man in going, shook
      hands with Lotys and Sergius Thord,&mdash;the lamps were extinguished, and
      the landlord standing in the porch of his tavern watched them all file
      out, and bade them all a cordial farewell. Pequita's home was with her
      father in the house where Sergius Thord dwelt, and Lotys kissing her
      tenderly good-night, left her to Thord's care.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And who will see you home, Lotys?" enquired Thord.
    </p>
    <p>
      "May I for once have that honour?" asked Pasquin Leroy. His two companions
      stared in undisguised amazement, and there was a moment's silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Lotys spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You may!" she said simply.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was another silence while she put on her hat, and wrapped herself in
      her long dark cloak. Then Thord took Pequita by the hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good-night, Lotys!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good-night, Sergius!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Leroy turned to his two friends and spoke to them in a low tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Go your ways!" he said peremptorily; "I will join you later!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Vain were their alarmed looks of remonstrance; and in another moment all
      the party had separated, and only Max Graub and Axel Regor remained on the
      pavement outside the tavern, disconsolately watching two figures
      disappearing in the semi-shadowed moonlight&mdash;Pasquin Leroy and Lotys&mdash;walking
      closely side by side.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Was there ever such a drama as this?" muttered Graub, "He may lose his
      life at any moment!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "If he does," responded Regor, "It will not be our fault. We do our best
      to guard him from the consequence of one folly,&mdash;and he straightway
      runs into another! There is no help for it; we have sworn to obey him, and
      we must keep our oath!"
    </p>
    <p>
      They passed slowly along the street, too absorbed in their own
      uncomfortable reflections for the interchange of many words. By the rules
      of the Revolutionary Committee, they were not allowed 'to follow or track
      any other member' so they were careful to walk in a reverse direction to
      that taken by their late comrades. The great bell of the Cathedral boomed
      midnight as they climbed towards the citadel, and the pale moon peeping
      whitely through piled-up fleecy clouds, shed a silver glare upon the quiet
      sea. And down into the 'slums,' down, and ever deeper, into the sad and
      cheerless 'Quarter of the Poor' Pasquin Leroy walked as though he trod
      lightly on a path of flowers,&mdash;his heart beating high, and his soul
      fully awakened within him, thrilled, he knew not why, to the heart's core
      by the soft low voice of Lotys,&mdash;and glad that in the glimpses of the
      moonlight her eyes were occasionally lifted to his face, with something of
      a child's trust, if not of a woman's tenderness.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXI. &mdash; AN INVITATION TO COURT
    </h2>
    <p>
      The spring was now advancing into full summer, and some time had passed
      since the Socialist party had gathered under their leaders to the voice of
      Lotys. Troublous days appeared to be impending for the Senate, and rumours
      of War,&mdash;war sometimes apparently imminent, and again suddenly
      averted,&mdash;had from time to time worried the public through the Press.
      But what was even more disturbing to the country, was the proposed
      infliction of new, heavy and irritating taxes, which had begun to affect
      the popular mind to the verge of revolt. Twice since Lotys had spoken at
      the People's Assembly Rooms had Sergius Thord addressed huge mass
      meetings, which apparently the police had no orders to disperse, and his
      power over the multitude was increasing by leaps and bounds. Whenever he
      spoke, wherever he worked, the indefatigable Pasquin Leroy was constantly
      at his side, and he, in his turn began to be recognized by the
      Revolutionary Committee as one of their most energetic members,&mdash;able,
      resolute, and above all, of an invaluably inscrutable and self-contained
      demeanour. His two comrades were not so effectual in their assistance, and
      appeared to act merely in obedience to his instructions. Their attitude,
      however, suited everyone concerned as well as, if not better than, if they
      had been overzealous. Owing to what Leroy had stated concerning the
      possibility of his arrest as a spy, his name was never mentioned in public
      by one single member of the Brotherhood; and to the outside Socialist
      following, he therefore appeared simply as one of the many who worked
      under Sergius Thord's command. Meanwhile, there were not lacking many
      other subjects for popular concern and comment; all of which in their turn
      gave rise to anxious discussion and vague conjecture. A Cabinet Council
      had been held by the Premier, at which, without warning, the King had
      attended personally, but the results were not made known to the public.
      Yet the general impression was that his Majesty seemed to be perfectly
      indifferent to the feelings or the well-being of his subjects; in fact, as
      some of them said with dismal shakings of the head, "It was all a part of
      the system; kings were not allowed to do anything even for the benefit of
      their people." And rising Socialism, ever growing stronger, and amassing
      in its ranks all the youthful and ambitious intellects of the time, agreed
      and swore that it was time for a Republic. Only by a complete change of
      Government could the cruelly-increasing taxation be put down; and if
      Government was to be changed, why not the dummy figure-head of Government
      as well?
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus Rumour talked, sometimes in whispers&mdash;sometimes in shouts;&mdash;but
      through it all the life of the Court and fashion went on in the same way,&mdash;the
      King continued to receive with apparent favour the most successful and
      most moneyed men from all parts of the world; the Queen drove or walked,
      or rode;&mdash;and the only prospective change in the social routine was
      the report that the Crown Prince was about to leave the country for a tour
      round the world, and that he would start on his journey in his own yacht
      about the end of the month. The newspapers made a great fuss in print over
      this projected tour; but the actual people were wholly indifferent to it.
      They had seen very little of the Crown Prince,&mdash;certainly not enough
      to give him their affection; and whether he left the kingdom or stayed in
      it concerned them not at all. He had done nothing marked or decisive in
      his life to show either talent, originality of character, or resolution;
      and the many 'puffs' in the press concerning him, were scarcely read at
      all by the public, or if they were, they were not credited. The expression
      of an ordinary working-man with regard to his position was entirely
      typical of the general popular sentiment;&mdash;"If he would only do
      something to prove he had a will of his own, and a mind, he would perhaps
      be able to set the Throne more firmly on its legs than it is at present."
    </p>
    <p>
      How thoroughly the young man <i>had</i> proved that he indeed possessed 'a
      will of his own,' was not yet disclosed to the outside critics of his life
      and conduct. Only the King and Queen, and Professor von Glauben knew it;&mdash;for
      even Sir Roger de Launay had not been entrusted with the story of his
      secret marriage. The Queen had received the news with her usual
      characteristic immobility. A faint cold smile had parted her lips as she
      listened to the story of her son's romance,&mdash;and her reply to the
      King's brief explanation was almost as brief:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nearly all the aristocracy marry music-hall women!" she said; "One should
      therefore be grateful that a Crown Prince does not go lower in his
      matrimonial choice than an innocent little peasant!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The marriage is useless, of course," said the King; "It has satisfied
      Humphry's exalted notions of honour; but it can never be acknowledged or
      admitted."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course not!" she agreed languidly; "It certainly clears up the mystery
      of The Islands, which you were so anxious to visit;&mdash;and I suppose
      the next thing you will do is to marry him again to some daughter of a
      Royal house?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Most assuredly!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "As <i>you</i> were married to <i>me?</i>" she said, raising her eyes to
      his face with that strange deep look which spoke eloquently of some
      mystery hidden in her soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      His cheeks burned with an involuntary flush. He bowed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Precisely! As I married you!" he replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The experiment was hardly successful!" she said with her little cold
      smile. "I fear you have often regretted it!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at her, studying her beauty intently,&mdash;and the remembrance
      of another face, far less fair of feature, but warm and impassioned by the
      lovely light of sympathy and tenderness, came between his eyes and hers,
      like a heavenly vision.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Had you loved me," he said slowly, "I might never have known what it was
      to need love!"
    </p>
    <p>
      A slight tremor ran through her veins. There was a strange tone in his
      voice,&mdash;a soft cadence to which she was unaccustomed,&mdash;something
      that suggested a new emotion in his life, and a deeper experience.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I never loved anyone in my life!" she answered calmly&mdash;"And now the
      days are past for loving. Humphry, however, has made up for my lack of the
      tender passion!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned away indifferently, and appeared to dismiss the matter
      altogether from her mind. The first time she saw her son, however, after
      hearing of his marriage, she looked at him curiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And so your wife is very lovely, Humphry!" she said with a slightly
      derisive smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was not startled by the suddenness of her observation nor put out by
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She is the loveliest woman I have ever seen,&mdash;not excepting
      yourself," he replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is a very foolish affair!" she continued composedly; "But fortunately
      in our line of life such things are easily arranged;&mdash;and your future
      will not be spoiled by it. I am glad you are going abroad, as you will
      very soon forget!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The Prince regarded her steadfastly with something of grave wonderment as
      well as compassion,&mdash;but he made no reply, and with the briefest
      excuse left her presence as soon as possible, in order to avoid further
      conversation on the subject. She, herself, however, found her mind
      curiously perturbed and full of conjectures concerning her son's idyllic
      love-story, in which all considerations for her as Queen and mother seemed
      omitted,&mdash;and where she, as it were, appeared to be shut outside a
      lover's paradise, the delights of which she had never experienced. The
      King held many private conferences with her on the matter, in which
      sometimes Professor von Glauben was permitted to share;&mdash;and the
      upshot of these numerous discussions resulted in a scheme which was as
      astonishing in its climax as it was unexpected. Over and over again it has
      been proved to nations as well as to individuals, that the whole course of
      events may be changed by the fixed determination of one resolute mind; but
      it is not often that the moral force of a mere girl succeeds in competing
      with the authority of kings and parliaments. But so it chanced on this
      occasion, and in the following manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      One glorious early morning, the sun having risen without a cloud in the
      deep blue of the sky, and the sea being as calm as an inland lake, the
      King's yacht was seen to weigh anchor and steam away at her fullest speed
      towards The Islands. Little or no preparation had been made for her short
      voyage; there was no Royal party on board, and the only passenger was
      Professor von Glauben. He sat solitary on deck in a luxurious chair,
      smoking his meerschaum pipe, and dubiously considering the difficult and
      peculiar situation in which he was placed. He made no attempt to calculate
      the possible success or failure of his mission&mdash;'for,' said he very
      sagely, 'it all depends on a woman, and God alone knows what a woman will
      do! Her ways are dark and wonderful, and altogether beyond the limit of
      the comprehension of man!'
    </p>
    <p>
      His journey was undertaken at the King's command; and equally by the
      King's command he had been compelled to keep it a secret from Prince
      Humphry. He had never been to The Islands since the King's 'surprise
      visit' there, and he was of course not aware that Gloria now knew the real
      rank and position of her supposed 'sailor' husband. He was at present
      charged to break the news to her, and bring her straightway to the palace,
      there to confront both the King and Queen, and learn from them the true
      state of affairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is a cruel ordeal," he said, shaking his head sorrowfully; "Yet I
      myself am a party to its being tried. For once in my life I have pinned my
      faith on the unspoilt soul of an unworldly woman. I wonder what will come
      of it? It rests entirely with Gloria herself, and with no one else in the
      world!"
    </p>
    <p>
      As the yacht arrived at its destination and dropped anchor at some
      distance from the pier, owing to the shallowness of the tide at that hour
      of the day, The Islands presented a fair aspect in the dancing beams of
      the summer sunlight. Numbers of fruit trees were bursting into blossom,&mdash;the
      apple, the cherry, the pink almond and the orange blossom all waved
      together and whispered sweetness to one another in the pure air, and the
      full-flowering mimosa perfumed every breath of wind. Fishermen were
      grouped here and there on the shore, mending or drying their nets; and in
      the fields beyond could be perceived many workers pruning the hedges or
      guiding the plough. The vision of a perfect Arcadia was presented to the
      eye; and so the Professor thought, as getting into the boat lowered for
      him, he was rowed from the yacht to the landing-place, and there dismissed
      the sailors, warning them that at the first sound of his whistle they
      should swiftly come for him again.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What a pity to spoil her peace of mind&mdash;her simplicity of life!" he
      thought, as he walked at a slow and reluctant pace towards Ronsard's
      cottage; "And I fear we shall have trouble with the old man! I wonder if
      his philosophy will stand hard wear and tear!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The pretty, low timber-raftered house confronted him at the next bend in
      the road, and presented a charming aspect of tranquillity. The grass in
      front of it was smooth as velvet and emerald-green, and in one of the
      flower borders Ronsard himself was digging and planting. He looked up as
      he heard the gate open, but did not attempt to interrupt his work;&mdash;and
      Von Glauben advanced towards him with a considerable sense of anxiety and
      insecurity in his mind. Anon he paused in the very act of greeting, as the
      old man turned his strong, deeply-furrowed countenance upon him with a
      look of fierce indignation and scorn.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So! You are here!" he said; "Have you come to look upon the evil your
      Royal master has worked? Or to make dutiful obeisance to Gloria as
      Crown-Princess?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Von Glauben was altogether taken aback.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then&mdash;you know&mdash;?" he stammered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh yes, I know!" responded Ronsard sternly and bitterly; "I know
      everything! There has been full confession! If the husband of my Gloria
      were more prince than man, my knife would have slit his throat! But he is
      more man than prince!&mdash;and I have let him live&mdash;for her sake!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well&mdash;that is so far good!" said Von Glauben, wiping the
      perspiration from his brow, and heaving a deep sigh of relief; "And as you
      fully comprehend the situation, it saves me the trouble of explaining it!
      You are a philosopher, Ronsard! Permit me to remind you of that fact! You
      know, like myself, that what is done, even if it is done foolishly, cannot
      be undone!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know it! Who should know it so well as I!" and Ronsard set a delicate
      rose-tree roughly in the hole he had dug for it, and began to fiercely
      pile in the earth around it;&mdash;"Fate is fate, and there is no
      gainsaying it! The law of Compensation will always have its way! Look you,
      man!&mdash;and listen! I, Réné Ronsard, once killed a king!&mdash;and now
      in my old age, the only creature I ever loved is tricked by the son of a
      king! It is just! So be it!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He bent his white head over his digging again, and Von Glauben was for a
      moment silent, vaguely amazed and stupefied by this sudden declaration of
      a past crime.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You should not say 'tricked,' my friend!" he at last ventured to remark;
      "Prince Humphry is an honest lad;&mdash;he means to keep his word!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Ronsard looked up, his eyes gleaming with fury.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Keep his word? Bah! How can he? Who in this wide realm will give him the
      honourable liberty to keep his word? Will he acknowledge Gloria as his
      wife before the nation?&mdash;she a foundling and a castaway? Will he make
      her his future queen? Not he! He will forsake her, and live with another
      woman, in sin which the law will sanctify!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He went on planting the rose-tree, then,&mdash;dropping his spade,&mdash;tossed
      up his head and hands with a wild gesture.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What, and who is this God who so ordains our destiny!" he exclaimed; "For
      surely this is His work,&mdash;not mine! Hidden away from all the world
      with my life's secret buried in my soul, I, without wife, or children or
      friends, or any soul on earth to care whether I lived or died, was sent an
      angel comforter;&mdash;the child I rescued from the sea! 'Gloria, Gloria
      in excelsis Deo!' the choristers sang in the church when I found her! I
      thought it true! With her,&mdash;in every action, in every thought and
      word, I strove,&mdash;and have faithfully striven,&mdash;to atone for my
      past crime;&mdash;for I was forced through others to kill that king! When
      proved guilty of the deed, I was told by my associates to assume madness,&mdash;a
      mere matter of acting,&mdash;and, being adjudged as insane, I was sent
      with other criminals on a convict ship, bound for a certain coast-prison,
      where we were all to be kept for life. The ship was wrecked off the rocks
      yonder, and it was reported that every soul on board went down, but I
      escaped&mdash;only I,&mdash;for what inscrutable reason God alone knows!
      Finding myself saved and free, I devoted my life to hard work, and to
      doing all the good I could think of to atone&mdash;to atone&mdash;always
      to atone! Then the child was sent to me; and I thought it was a sign that
      my penance was accepted; but no!&mdash;no!&mdash;the compensating curse
      falls,&mdash;not on me,&mdash;not on me, for if only so, I would welcome
      it&mdash;but on Her!&mdash;the child of my love&mdash;the heart of my
      heart!&mdash;on Her!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned away his face, and a hard sob broke from his labouring chest.
      Von Glauben laid a gentle, protective hand on his shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ronsard, be a man!" he said in a kind, firm voice; "This is the first
      time you have told me your true history&mdash;and&mdash;I shall respect
      your confidence! You have suffered much&mdash;equally you have loved much!
      Doubt not that you are forgiven much. But why should you assume, or
      foresee unhappiness for Gloria? Why talk of a curse where perhaps there is
      only an intended blessing? Is she unhappy, that you are thus moved?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Ronsard furtively dashed away the tears from his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She? Gloria unhappy? No,&mdash;not yet! The delights of spring and summer
      have met in her smile,&mdash;her eyes, her movements! It was she herself
      who told me all! If he had told me, I would have killed him!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Eminently sensible!" said Von Glauben, recovering his usual phlegmatic
      calm; "You would have killed the man she loves best in the world. And so
      with perfect certainty you would have killed her as well,&mdash;and
      probably yourself afterwards. A perfect slaughterhouse, like the last
      scene in Hamlet, by the so admirable Shakespeare! It is better as it is.
      Life is really very pleasant!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He sniffed the perfumed air,&mdash;listened with appreciation to the
      trilling of a bird swinging on a bough of apple-blossom above him, and
      began to feel quite easy in his mind. Half his mission was done for him,
      Prince Humphry having declared himself in his true colours. "I always
      said," mused the Professor, "that he was a very honest young man! And I
      think he will be honest to the end." Aloud he asked:
    </p>
    <p>
      "When did you know the truth?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Some days since," replied Ronsard. "He&mdash;Gloria's husband&mdash;I can
      as yet call him by no other name&mdash;came suddenly one evening;&mdash;the
      two went out together as usual, and then&mdash;then my child returned
      alone. She told me all,&mdash;of the disguise he had assumed&mdash;and of
      his real identity&mdash;and I&mdash;well! I think I was mad! I know I
      spoke and acted like a madman!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nay, rather say like a philosopher!" murmured Von Glauben with a humorous
      smile; "Remember, my good fellow, that there is no human being who loses
      self-control more easily and rapidly than he who proclaims the advantage
      of keeping it! And what did Gloria say to you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Ronsard looked up at the tranquil skies, and was for a moment silent. Then
      he answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Gloria is&mdash;just Gloria! There is no woman like her,&mdash;there
      never will be any woman like her! She said nothing at all while I raged
      and swore;&mdash;she stood before me white and silent,&mdash;grand and
      calm, like some great angel. Then when I cursed <i>him,</i>&mdash;she
      raised her hand, and like a queen she said: 'I forbid you to utter one
      word against him!' I stood before her mute and foolish. 'I forbid you!'
      She,&mdash;the child I reared and nurtured&mdash;menaced me with her
      'command' as though I were her slave and servant! You see I have lost her!&mdash;she
      is not mine any more&mdash;she is <i>his</i>&mdash;to be treated as he
      wills, and made the toy of his pleasure! She does not know the world, but
      I know it! I know the misery that is in store for her! But there is yet
      time&mdash;and I will live to avenge her wrong!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Possibly there will be no wrong to avenge," said Von Glauben composedly;
      "But if there is, I have no doubt you would kill another king!" Ronsard
      turned pale and shuddered. "It is stupid work, killing kings," went on the
      Professor; "It never does any good; and often increases the evil it was
      intended to cure. Your studies in philosophy must have taught you that
      much at least! As for your losing Gloria,&mdash;you lost her in a sense
      when you gave her to her husband. It is no use complaining now, because
      you find he is not the man you took him for. The mischief is done. At any
      rate you are bound to admit that Gloria has, so far, been perfectly happy;
      she will be happy still, I truly believe, for she has the secret of
      happiness in her own beautiful nature. And you, Ronsard, must make the
      best of things, and meet fate with calmness. To-day, for instance, I am
      here by the King's command,&mdash;I bear his orders,&mdash;and I have come
      for Gloria. They want her at the Palace."
    </p>
    <p>
      Ronsard stepped out of his flower-border, and stood on the greensward
      amazed, and indignantly suspicious.
    </p>
    <p>
      "They want her at the Palace!" he repeated; "Why? What for? To do her
      harm? To make her miserable? To insult and threaten her? No, she shall not
      go!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Look here, my friend," said the Professor with mild patience; "You have&mdash;for
      a philosopher&mdash;a most unpleasant habit of jumping to wrong
      conclusions! Please endeavour to compose the tumult in your soul, and
      listen to me! The King has sent for Gloria, and I am instructed to take
      charge of her, and escort her to the presence of their Majesties. No
      insult, no threat, no wrong is intended. I will bring her back again safe
      to you immediately the audience is concluded. Be satisfied, Ronsard! For
      once 'put your trust in princes,' for her husband will be there,&mdash;and
      do you think he would suffer her to be insulted or wronged?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Ronsard's sunken eyes looked wild,&mdash;his aged frame trembled
      violently, and he gave a hopeless gesture.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do not know&mdash;I do not know!" he said incoherently; "I am an old
      man, and I have always found it a wicked world! But&mdash;if you give me
      your word that she shall come to no harm, I will trust <i>you</i>!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Silently Von Glauben took his hand and pressed it. Two or three minutes
      passed, weighted with unuttered and unutterable thoughts in the minds of
      both men; and then, in a somewhat hushed voice, the Professor said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ronsard, I am just now reminded of the tragic story of Rudolf of Austria,
      who killed himself through the maddening sorrow of an ill-fated love! We,
      in our different lines of life should remember that,&mdash;and let no
      young innocent heart suffer through our follies&mdash;our rages against
      fate&mdash;our conventions&mdash;our more or less idiotic laws of
      restraint and hypocrisy. The tragedy of Prince Rudolf and the unhappy
      Marie Vetsera whom he worshipped, was caused by the sin and the falsehood
      of others,&mdash;not by the victims of the cruel catastrophe. Therefore, I
      say to you, my friend, be wise in time!&mdash;and control the natural
      stormy tendency of your passions in this present affair. I assure you, on
      my faith and honour as a man, that the King has a kindly heart and a brave
      one,&mdash;together with a strong sense of justice. He is not truly known
      to his people;&mdash;they only see him through the pens of press
      reporters, or the slavish descriptions of toadies and parasites. Then
      again, the Crown Prince is an honourable lad; and from what I know of him,
      he is not likely to submit to conventional usages in matters which are
      close to his life and heart. Gloria herself is of such an exceptional
      character and disposition, that I think she may be safely left to
      arbitrate her own destiny&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And the Queen?" interrupted Ronsard suddenly;&mdash;"She, at any rate, as
      a woman, wife and mother, will be gentle?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Gentle, she certainly is," said Von Glauben, with a slight sigh; "But
      only because she does not consider it worth while to be otherwise! God has
      put a stone in the place where her heart should be! However,&mdash;she
      will have little to say, and still less to do with to-day's business. You
      tell me you will trust me; I promise you, you shall not repent your trust!
      But I must see Gloria herself. Where is she?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Ronsard pointed towards the cottage.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She is in there, studying," he said; "Books of the old time;&mdash;books
      that few read. She gets them all from Sergius Thord. How would it be,
      think you, if he knew?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The pleasantly rubicund countenance of the Professor grew a shade paler.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sergius Thord&mdash;Sergius Thord?&mdash;H'm&mdash;h'm&mdash;let me see!&mdash;who
      is he? Ah! I remember,&mdash;he is the Socialist lion, for ever roaring
      through the streets and seeking whom he may devour! I daresay he is not
      without cleverness!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Cleverness!" echoed Ronsard; "That is a tame word! He has genius, and the
      people swear by him. Since the proposed new taxation, and other injustices
      of the Government, he has gained adherents by many thousands. You,&mdash;whom
      I once took to be a mere German schoolmaster, a friend of the young
      'sailor' whom my child so innocently wedded,&mdash;you whom I now know to
      be the King's physician&mdash;surely you cannot live on the mainland, and
      in the metropolis, without knowing of the power of Sergius Thord?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know something&mdash;not much;" replied the Professor guardedly; "But
      come, my friend, <i>I</i> have not deceived you! I was in very truth a
      poor 'German schoolmaster,' once,&mdash;before I became a student of
      medicine and surgery. And that I am the King's physician, is merely one of
      those accidental circumstances which occur in a world of chance. But
      schoolmaster as I have been, I doubt if I would set our 'Glory-of-the-Sea'
      to study books recommended to her by Sergius Thord. The poetry of Heine is
      more suitable to her age and sex. Let us break in upon her meditations."
      And he walked across the grass with one arm thrust through that of
      Ronsard; "For she must prepare herself. We ought to be gone within an
      hour."
    </p>
    <p>
      They passed under the low, rose-covered porch into a wide square room,
      with raftered ceiling and deep carved oak ingle nook,&mdash;and here at
      the table, with a quarto volume opened out before her, sat Gloria, resting
      her head on one fair hand, her rich hair falling about her in loose
      shining tresses, and her whole attitude expressive of the deepest
      absorption in study. As they entered, she looked up and smiled,&mdash;then
      rose, her hand still resting on the open book.
    </p>
    <p>
      "At last you have come again, dear Professor!" she said; "I began to think
      you had grown weary in well-doing!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Von Glauben stared at her, stricken speechless for a moment. What
      mysterious change had passed over the girl, investing her with such an air
      of regal authority? It was impossible to say. To all appearance she was
      the same beautiful creature, clad in the same simple white homespun gown,&mdash;yet
      were she Empress of half the habitable globe, she could not have looked
      more environed with dignity, sweetness and delicately gracious manner. He
      understood the desolating expression of Ronsard,&mdash;'You see I have
      lost her!&mdash;she is not mine any more&mdash;she is his!' He recognised
      and was suddenly impressed by that fact;&mdash;she was 'his'&mdash;the
      wife of the Crown Prince and Heir-Apparent to the Throne;&mdash;and
      evidently with the knowledge of her position had arisen the pride of love
      and the spirit of grace to support her honours worthily. And so, as Von
      Glauben met her eyes, which expressed their gentle wonder at his silence,
      and as she extended her hand to him, he came slowly forward and bowing
      low, respectfully kissed that hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Princess," he said, in a voice that trembled ever so slightly; "I shall
      never be weary in well-doing,&mdash;if you are good enough to call my
      service and friendship for you by that name! I hesitated to come before,&mdash;because
      I thought&mdash;I feared&mdash;I did not know!&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I understand!" said Gloria tranquilly; "You did not think the Prince, my
      husband, would tell me the truth so soon! But I know all, and now&mdash;I
      am glad to know it! Dearest," and she moved swiftly to Ronsard who was
      standing silent in the doorway&mdash;"come in and sit down! You make
      yourself so tired sometimes in the garden;" and she threw a loving arm
      about him. "You must rest; you look so pale!"
    </p>
    <p>
      For all answer, he lifted the hand that hung about his neck, to his lips
      and kissed it tenderly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "They want you, Gloria!" he said tremulously; "They want you at the
      Palace. You must go to-day!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She lifted her brilliant eyes enquiringly to Von Glauben, who responded to
      the look by at once explaining his mission. He was there, he said, by the
      King's special command;&mdash;their Majesties had been informed of their
      son's marriage by their son himself; and they desired at once to see and
      speak with their unknown daughter-in-law. The interview would be private;
      his Royal Highness the Crown Prince would be present;&mdash;it might last
      an hour, perhaps longer,&mdash;and he, Von Glauben, was entrusted to bring
      Gloria to the Palace, and escort her back to The Islands again when all
      was over. Thus, with elaborate and detailed courtesy, the Professor
      unfolded the nature of his enterprise, while Gloria, still keeping one arm
      round Ronsard, heard and smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall obey the King's command!" she said composedly; "Though,&mdash;having
      no word from the Prince, my husband, concerning this mandate,&mdash;I
      might very well refuse to do so! But it may be as well that their
      Majesties and their son's wife should plainly, and once for all,
      understand each other. Dear Professor, you look sadly troubled. Is there
      some little convention, some special ceremonial of so-called 'good
      manners,' which you are commissioned to teach me, before I make my
      appearance at Court under your escort?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Her lovely lips smiled,&mdash;her eyes laughed,&mdash;she looked the very
      incarnation of Beauty triumphant. Von Glauben's brain whirled,&mdash;he
      felt bewitched and dazzled.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I?&mdash;to teach you anything? No, my princess!&mdash;and please think
      how loyally I have called you 'Princess' from the beginning!&mdash;I have
      always told you that you have a spiritual knowledge far surpassing all
      material wisdom. Conventions and ceremonials are not for you,&mdash;you
      will make fashion, not follow it! I am not troubled, save for your sake,
      dear child!&mdash;for you know nothing of the world, and the ways of the
      Court may at first offend you&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The ways of Hell must have seemed dark to Proserpine," said Ronsard in
      his harsh, strong voice; "But Love gave her light!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A very just reminder!" said Von Glauben, well pleased;&mdash;"Consider
      Gloria to be the new Proserpine to-day! And now she must forgive me for
      playing the part of a tyrannical friend, and urging her to hasten her
      preparations."
    </p>
    <p>
      Gloria bent down and kissed Ronsard gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Trust me, little father!" she whispered; "You have not taught me great
      lessons of truth in vain!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Aloud she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The King and Queen wish to see me and speak with me,&mdash;and I know the
      reason why! They desire to fully explain to me all that my husband has
      already told me,&mdash;which is that according to the rules made for
      monarchs, our marriage is inadmissible. Well!&mdash;I have my answer
      ready; and you, Professor, shall hear me give it! Wait but a few moments
      and I will come with you."
    </p>
    <p>
      She left the room. The two men looked at each other in silence. At last
      Von Glauben said:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ronsard, I think you will soon reap the reward of your 'life-philosophy'
      system! You have fed that girl from her childhood on strong intellectual
      food, and trained the mental muscles rather than the physical ones. Upon
      my word, I believe you will see a good result!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Ronsard, who had grown much calmer and quieter during the last few
      minutes, raised himself a little from the chair into which he had sunk
      with an air of fatigue, and looked dreamily towards the open lattice
      window, where the roses hung in a curtain of crimson blossom.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If it be so, I shall praise God!" he said; "But the years have come and
      gone with me so peacefully since I made my home on these quiet shores,
      that the exercise of what I have presumed to call 'philosophy' has had no
      chance. Philosophy! It is well to preach it,&mdash;but when the blow of
      misfortune falls, who can practise it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You can," replied the Professor;&mdash;"I can! Gloria can! I think we all
      three have clear brains. There is a tendency in the present age to
      overlook and neglect the greatest power in the whole human composition,&mdash;the
      mental and psychical part of it. Now, in the present curious drama of
      events, we have a chance given to exercise it; and it will be our own
      faults if we do not make our wills rule our destinies!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But the position is intolerable&mdash;impossible!" said Ronsard, rising
      and pacing the room with a fresh touch of agitation. "Nothing can do away
      with the fact that we&mdash;my child and I&mdash;have been cruelly
      deceived! And now there can be only one of two contingencies; Gloria must
      be acknowledged as the Prince's wife,&mdash;in which case he will be
      forced to resign all claim to the Throne;&mdash;or he must marry again,
      which makes her no wife at all. That is a disgrace which her pride would
      never submit to, nor mine;&mdash;for did I not kill a king?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let me advise you for the future not to allude to that disagreeable
      incident!" said Von Glauben persuasively: "Exercise discretion,&mdash;as I
      do! Observe that I do not ask you what king you killed;&mdash;I am as
      careful on that matter as I am concerning the reasons for which I myself
      left my native Fatherland! I make it a rule never to converse on painful
      subjects. You tell me you have tried to atone; then believe that the
      atonement is made, and that Gloria is the sign of its acceptance, and&mdash;happy
      augury!&mdash;here she comes."
    </p>
    <p>
      They both instinctively turned to confront the girl as she entered. She
      had changed her ordinary white homespun gown for another of the same kind,
      equally simple, but fresh and unworn; her glorious bronze-chestnut hair
      was unbound to its full rippling length, and was held back by a band or
      fillet of curiously carved white coral, which surmounted the rich tresses
      somewhat in the fashion of a small crown, and she carried, thrown over one
      arm, the only kind of cloak she ever wore,&mdash;a burnous-like wrap of
      the same white homespun as her dress, with a hood, which, as the Professor
      slowly took out his glasses and fixed them on his nose out of mere
      mechanical habit, to look at her more closely, she drew over her head and
      shoulders, the soft folds about her exquisite face completing a classic
      picture of such radiant beauty as is seldom seen nowadays among the
      increasingly imperfect and repulsive specimens of female humanity which
      'progress' combined with sensuality, produce for the 'advancement' of the
      race.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have no Court dress," she said smiling; "And if I had I should not wear
      it! The King and Queen shall see me as my husband sees me,&mdash;what
      pleases him, must suffice to please them! I am quite ready!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Von Glauben removed the spectacles he had needlessly put on. They were dim
      with a moisture which he furtively polished off, blinking his eyes
      meanwhile as if the light hurt him. He was profoundly moved&mdash;thrilled
      to the very core of his soul by the simplicity, frankness and courage of
      this girl whose education was chiefly out of wild Nature's lesson-book,
      and who knew nothing of the artificial world of fashion.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And I, my princess, am at your service!" he said; "Ronsard, it is but a
      few hours that we shall be absent. To-night with the rising of the moon we
      shall return, and I doubt not with the Prince himself as chief escort!
      Keep a good heart and have faith! All will be well!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "All <i>shall</i> be well if Love can make it so!" said Ronsard;&mdash;"Gloria&mdash;my
      child&mdash;!" He held out his wrinkled hands pathetically, unable to say
      more. She sank on her knees before him, and tenderly drawing down those
      hands upon her head, pressed them closely there.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your blessing, dearest!" she said; "Not in speech&mdash;but in thought!"
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a moment's sacred silence;&mdash;then Gloria rose, and throwing
      her arms round the old man, the faithful protector of her infancy and
      girlhood, kissed him tenderly. After that, she seemed to throw all
      seriousness to the winds, and running out under the roses of the porch
      made two or three light dancing steps across the lawn.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come!" she cried, her eyes sparkling, her face radiant with the gaiety of
      her inward spirit; "Come, Professor! This is not what we call a poet's day
      of dreams,&mdash;it is a Royal day of nonsense! Come!" and here she drew
      herself up with a stately air&mdash;"WE are prepared to confront the
      King!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The Professor caught the infection of her mirth, and quickly followed her;
      and within the next half-hour Réné Ronsard, climbing slowly to the summit
      of one of the nearest rocks on the shore adjacent to his dwelling, shaded
      his eyes from the dazzling sunlight on the sea, and strained them to watch
      the magnificent Royal yacht steaming swiftly over the tranquil blue water,
      with one slight figure clad in white leaning against the mast, a figure
      that waved its hand fondly towards The Islands, and of whom it might have
      been said:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  "Her gaze was glad past love's own singing of,
  And her face lovely past desire of love!"

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXII. &mdash; A FAIR DÉBUTANTE
    </h2>
    <p>
      That same afternoon there was a mysterious commotion at the Palace,&mdash;whispers
      ran from lip to lip among the few who had seen her, that a beautiful
      woman,&mdash;lovelier than the Queen herself,&mdash;had, under the escort
      of the uncommunicative Professor von Glauben, passed into the presence of
      the King and Queen, to receive the honour of a private audience. Who was
      she? What was she? Where did she come from? How was she dressed? This last
      question was answered first, being easiest to deal with. She was attired
      all in white,&mdash;'like a picture' said some&mdash;'like a statue' said
      others. No one, however, dared ask any direct question concerning her,&mdash;her
      reception, whoever she was, being of a strictly guarded nature, and
      peremptory orders having been given to admit no one to the Queen's
      presence-chamber, to which apartment she had been taken by the King's
      physician. But such dazzling beauty as hers could not go altogether
      unnoticed by the most casual attendant, sentinel, or lord-in-waiting, and
      the very fact that special commands had been issued to guard all the doors
      of entrance to the Royal apartments on either hand, during her visit, only
      served to pique and inflame the general curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meantime,&mdash;while lesser and inferior personages were commenting on
      the possibility of the unknown fair one being concerned with some dramatic
      incident that might have to be included among the King's numerous
      gallantries,&mdash;the unconscious subject of their discussion was quietly
      seated alone in an ante-room adjoining the Queen's apartments, waiting
      till Professor von Glauben should announce that their Majesties were ready
      to receive her. She was not troubled or anxious, or in any way ill at
      ease. She looked curiously upon the splendid evidences of Royal state,
      wealth and luxury which surrounded her, with artistic appreciation but no
      envy. She caught sight of her own face and figure in a tall mirror
      opposite to her, set in a silver frame; and she studied herself quietly
      and critically with the calm knowledge that there was nothing to deplore
      or to regret in the way God and Nature had been pleased to make her. She
      was not in the slightest degree vain,&mdash;but she knew that a healthy
      and quiet mind in a healthy and unspoilt body, together form what is
      understood as the highest beauty,&mdash;and that these two elements were
      not lacking in her. Moreover, she was conscious of a great love warming
      her heart and strengthening her soul,&mdash;and with this great
      motive-force to brace her nerves and add extra charm to her natural
      loveliness, she had no fear. She had enjoyed the swift voyage across the
      sparkling sea, and the fresh air had made her eyes doubly lustrous, her
      complexion even more than usually fair and brilliant. She did not permit
      herself to be rendered unhappy or anxious as to the possible attitude of
      the King and Queen towards her,&mdash;she was prepared for all
      contingencies, and had fully made up her mind what to say. Therefore,
      there was no need to fret over the position, or to be timorously concerned
      because she was called upon to confront those who by human law alone were
      made superior in rank to the rest of mankind.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In God's sight all men are equal!" she said to herself: "The King is a
      mere helpless babe at birth, dependant on others,&mdash;as he is a mere
      helpless corpse at death. It is only men's own foolish ideas and
      conventions of usage in life that make any difference!"
    </p>
    <p>
      At that moment the Professor entered hurriedly, and impulsively seizing
      her hands in his own, kissed them and pressed them tenderly. His face was
      flushed&mdash;he was evidently strongly excited.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Go in there now, Princess!" he whispered, pointing to the adjacent room,
      of which the door stood ajar; "And may God be on your side!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She rose up, and releasing her hands gently from his nervous grasp,
      smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do not be afraid!" she said; "You, too, are coming?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I follow you!" he replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      And to himself he said: "Ach, Gott in Himmel! Will she keep her so
      beautiful calm? If she will&mdash;if she can&mdash;a throne would be well
      lost for such a woman!"
    </p>
    <p>
      And he watched her with an admiration amounting almost to fear, as she
      passed before him and entered the Royal presence-chamber with a proud
      light step, a grace of bearing and a supreme distinction, which, had she
      been there on a day of diplomatic receptions, would have made half the
      women accustomed to attend Court, look like the merest vulgar plebeians.
    </p>
    <p>
      The room she entered was very large and lofty. A dazzle of gold ceiling,
      painted walls and mirrors flashed upon her eyes, with the hue of silken
      curtains and embroidered hangings,&mdash;the heavy perfume of hundreds of
      flowers in tall crystal vases and wide gilded stands made the air drowsy
      and odorous, and for a moment, Gloria, just fresh from the sweet breath of
      the sea, felt sickened and giddy,&mdash;but she recovered quickly, and
      raised her eyes fearlessly to the two motionless figures, which, like
      idols set in a temple for worship, waited her approach. The King, stiffly
      upright, and arrayed in military uniform, stood near the Queen, who was
      seated in a throne-like chair over-canopied with gold,&mdash;her trailing
      robes were of a pale azure hue bordered with ermine, and touched here and
      there with silver, giving out reflexes of light, stolen as it seemed from
      the sea and sky,&mdash;and her beautiful face, with its clear-cut features
      and cold pallor, might have been carved out of ivory, for all the interest
      or emotion expressed upon it. Gloria came straight towards her, then
      stopped. With her erect supple form, proud head and fair features, she
      looked the living embodiment of sovereign womanhood,&mdash;and the Queen,
      meeting the full starry glance of her eyes, stirred among her Royal
      draperies, and raised herself with a slow graceful air of critical
      observation, in which there was a touch of languid wonder mingled with
      contempt. Still Gloria stood motionless,&mdash;neither abashed nor
      intimidated,&mdash;she made no curtsey or reverential salutation of any
      kind, and presently removing her gaze from the Queen, she turned to the
      King.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You sent for me," she said; "And I have come. What do you want with me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The King smiled. What a dazzling Perfection was here, he thought! A second
      Una unarmed, and strong in the courage of innocence! But he was acting a
      special part, and he determined to play it well and thoroughly. So he gave
      her no reply, but turned with a stiff air to Von Glauben.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tell the girl to make her obeisance to the Queen!" he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Professor very reluctantly approached the 'Glory-of-the-Sea' with this
      suggestion, cautiously whispered. Gloria obeyed at once. Moving swiftly to
      the Queen's chair, she bent low before her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Madam!" she said, "I am told to kneel to you, because you are the Queen,&mdash;but
      it is not for that I do so. I kneel, because you are my husband's mother!"
    </p>
    <p>
      And raising the cold impassive hand covered with great gems, that rested
      idly on the rich velvets so near to her touch, she gently kissed it,&mdash;then
      rose up to her full height again.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is it always like this here?" she asked, gazing around her. "Do you
      always sit thus in a chair, dressed grandly and quite silent?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The smile deepened on the King's face; the Queen, perforce moved at last
      from her inertia, half rose with an air of amazement and indignation, and
      Von Glauben barely saved himself from laughing outright.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You," continued Gloria, fixing her bright glance on the King; "You have
      seen me before! You have spoken to me. Then why do you pretend not to know
      me now? Is that Court manners? If so, they are not good or kind!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The King relaxed his formal attitude, and addressed his Consort in a low
      tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is no use dealing with this girl in the conventional way," he said;
      "She is a mere child at heart, simple and uneducated;&mdash;we must treat
      her as such. Perhaps you will speak to her first?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, Sir, I much prefer that you should do so," she replied. "When I have
      heard her answers to you, it will be perhaps my turn!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Thereupon the King advanced a step or two, and Gloria regarded him
      steadfastly. Meeting the pure light of those lovely eyes, he lost
      something of his ordinary self-possession,&mdash;he was conscious of a
      certain sense of embarrassment and foolishness;&mdash;his very uniform,
      ablaze with gold and jewelled orders, seemed a clown's costume compared
      with the classic simplicity of Gloria's homespun garb, which might have
      fitly clothed a Greek goddess. Sensible of his nervous irritation, he
      however overcame it by an effort, and summoning all his dignity, he
      'graciously,' as the newspaper parasites put it, extended his hand. Gloria
      smiled archly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I kissed your hand the other day when you were cross!" she said; "You
      would like it kissed again? There!"
    </p>
    <p>
      And with easy grace of gesture she pressed her lips lightly upon it. It
      would have needed something stronger than mere flesh and blood to resist
      the natural playfulness and charm of her action, combined with her
      unparalleled beauty, and the King, who was daily and hourly proving for
      himself the power and intensity of that Spirit of Man which makes clamour
      for higher things than Man's conventionalities, became for the moment as
      helplessly overwhelmed and defeated by a woman's smile, a woman's eyes, as
      any hero of old times, whose conquests have been reported to us in history
      as achieved for the sake of love and beauty. But he was compelled to
      disguise his thoughts, and to maintain an outward expression of formality,
      particularly in the presence of his Queen-Consort,&mdash;and he withdrew
      the hand that bore her soft kiss upon it with a well-simulated air of
      chill tolerance. Then he spoke gravely, in measured precise accents.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Gloria Ronsard, we have sent for you in all kindness," he said; "out of a
      sincere wish to remedy any wrong which our son, the Crown Prince has, in
      the light folly and hot impulse of his youth, done to you in your life. We
      are given to understand that there is a boy-and-girl attachment between
      you; that he won your attachment under a disguised identity, and that you
      were thus innocently deceived,&mdash;and that, in order to satisfy his own
      honourable scruples, as well as your sense of maidenly virtue, he has,
      still under a disguise, gone through the ceremony of marriage with you.
      Therefore, it seems that you now imagine yourself to be his lawful wife.
      This is a very natural mistake for a girl to make who is as young and
      inexperienced as you are, and I am sorry,&mdash;very sorry for the false
      position in which my son the Crown Prince has so thoughtlessly placed you.
      But, after very earnest consideration, I,&mdash;and the Queen also,&mdash;think
      it much better for you to know the truth at once, so that you may fully
      realize the situation, and then, by the exercise of a little common sense,
      spare yourself any further delusion and pain. All we can do to repair the
      evil, you may rest assured shall be done. But you must thoroughly
      understand that the Crown Prince, as heir to the Throne, cannot marry out
      of his own station. If he should presume to do so, through some mad and
      hot-headed impulse, such a marriage is not admitted or agreed to by the
      nation. Thus you will see plainly that, though you have gone through the
      marriage ceremony with him, that counts as nothing in your case,&mdash;for,
      according to the law of the realm, and in the sight of the world, you are
      not, and cannot be his wife!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Gloria raised her deep bright eyes and smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No?" she said, and then was silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      The King regarded her with surprise, and a touch of anger. He had expected
      tears, passionate declamations, and reiterated assurances of the
      unalterable and indissoluble tie between herself and her lover, but this
      little indifferently-queried "No?" upset all his calculations.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you nothing to say?" he asked, somewhat sternly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What should I say?" she responded, still smiling; "You are the King; it
      is for you to speak!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "She does not understand you, Sir," interrupted the Queen coldly; "Your
      words are possibly too elaborate for her simple comprehension!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Gloria turned a fearless beautiful glance upon her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pardon me, Madam, but I do understand!" she said; "I understand that by
      the law of God I am your son's wife, and that by the law of the world I am
      no wife! I abide by the law of God!"
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a moment's dead silence. Professor von Glauben gave a discreet
      cough to break it, and the King, reminded of his presence turned towards
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Has she no sense of the position?" he demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sir, I have every reason to believe that she grasps it thoroughly!"
      replied Von Glauben with a deferential bow.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then why&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      But here he was again interrupted by the Queen. She, raising herself in
      her chair, her beautiful head and shoulders lifted statue-like from her
      enshrining draperies of azure and white, stretched forth a hand and
      beckoned Gloria towards her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come here, child!" she said; then as Gloria advanced with evident
      reluctance, she added; "Come closer&mdash;you must not be afraid of me!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Gloria smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nay, Madam, trouble not yourself at all in that regard! I never was
      afraid of anyone!"
    </p>
    <p>
      A shadow of annoyance darkened the Queen's fair brows.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Since you have no fear, you may equally have no shame!" she said in
      icy-cold accents; "Therefore it is easy to understand why you deliberately
      refuse to see the harm and cruelty done to our son, the Crown Prince, by
      his marriage with you, if such marriage were in the least admissible,
      which fortunately for all concerned, it is not. He is destined to occupy
      the Throne, and he must wed someone who is fit to share it. Kings and
      princes may love where they choose,&mdash;but they can only marry where
      they must! You are my son's first love;&mdash;the thought and memory of
      that may perhaps be a consolation to you,&mdash;but do not assume that you
      will be his last!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Gloria drew back from her; her face had paled a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You can speak so!" she said sorrowfully; "You,&mdash;his mother! Poor
      Queen&mdash;poor woman! I am sorry for you!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Without pausing to notice the crimson flush of vexation that flew over the
      Queen's delicate face at her words, she turned, now with some haughtiness,
      to the King.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Speak plainly!" she said; "What is it you want of me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Her flashing eyes, her proud look startled him&mdash;he moved back a step
      or two. Then he replied with as much firmness and dignity as he could
      assume.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing is wanted of you, my child, but obedience and loyalty! Resign all
      claim upon the Crown Prince as his wife; promise never to see him again,
      or correspond with him,&mdash;and&mdash;you shall lose nothing by the
      sacrifice you make of your little love affair to the good of the country."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The good of the country!" echoed Gloria in thrilling tones. "Do <i>you</i>
      know anything about it? You&mdash;who never go among your people except to
      hunt and shoot and amuse yourself generally? You, who permit wicked liars
      and spendthrifts to gamble with the people's money! The good of the
      country! If my life could only lift the burden of taxation from the
      country, I would lay it down gladly and freely! If I were Queen, do you
      think I could be like her?" and she stretched forth her white arm to where
      the Queen, amazed, had risen from her seat, and now stood erect, her rich
      robes trailing yards on the ground, and flashing at every point with
      jewels. "Do you think I could sit unmoved, clad in rich velvet and gems,
      while one single starving creature sought bread within my kingdom? Nay, I
      would sell everything I possessed and go barefoot rather! I would be a
      sister, not a mere 'patroness' to the poor;&mdash;I would never wear a
      single garment that had not been made for me by the workers of my own
      land;&mdash;and the 'good of the country' should be 'good' indeed, not
      'bad,' as it is now!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Breathless with the sudden rush of her thoughts into words, she stood with
      heaving bosom and sparkling eyes, the incarnation of eloquence and
      inspiration, and before the astonished monarch could speak, she went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am your son's wife! He loves me&mdash;he has wedded me honourably and
      lawfully. You wish me to disclaim that. I will not! From him and him
      alone, must come my dismissal from his heart, his life and his soul. If he
      desires his marriage with me dissolved, let him tell me so himself face to
      face, and before you and his mother! Then I shall be content to be no more
      his wife. But not till then! I will promise nothing without his consent.
      He is my husband,&mdash;and to him I owe my first obedience. I seek no
      honour, no rank, no wealth,&mdash;but I have won the greatest treasure in
      this world, his love!&mdash;and that I will keep!"
    </p>
    <p>
      A door opened at the further end of the room&mdash;a curtain was quietly
      pushed aside, and the Crown Prince entered. With a composed, almost formal
      demeanour, he saluted the King and Queen, and then going up to Gloria,
      passed his arm around her waist, and held her fast.
    </p>
    <p>
      "When you have concluded your interview with my wife, Sir,&mdash;an
      interview of which I had no previous knowledge," he said quietly,
      addressing the King; "I shall be glad to have one of my own with her!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The King answered him calmly enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your wife,&mdash;as you call her,&mdash;is a very incorrigible young
      person," he said. "The sooner she returns to her companions, the
      fisher-folk on The Islands, the better! From her looks I imagined she
      might have sense; but I fear that is lacking to her composition! However,
      she is perfectly willing to consider her marriage with you dissolved, if
      you desire it. I trust you <i>will</i> desire it;&mdash;here, now, and at
      once, in my presence and that of the Queen, your mother;&mdash;and thus a
      very unpleasant and unfortunate incident in your career will be
      satisfactorily closed!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Prince Humphry smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dissolve the heavens and its stars into a cup of wine, and drink them all
      down at one gulp!" he said; "And then, perhaps, you may dissolve my
      marriage with this lady! If you consider it illegal, put the question to
      the Courts of Law;&mdash;to the Pope, who most strenuously supports the
      sanctity of the marriage-tie;&mdash;ask all who know anything of the
      sacrament, whether, when two people love each other, and are bound by holy
      matrimony to be as one, and are mutually resolved to so remain, any
      earthly power can part them! 'Those whom God hath joined together, let no
      man put asunder.' Is that mere lip mockery, or is it a holy bond?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The King gave an impatient gesture.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is no use in argument," he said, "when argument has to be carried
      on with such children as yourselves. What cannot be done by persuasion,
      must be done by force. I wished to act kindly and reasonably by both of
      you&mdash;and I had hoped better things from this interview,&mdash;but as
      matters have turned out, it may as well be concluded."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wait!" said Gloria, disengaging herself gently from her husband's
      embrace; "I have something to say which ought to meet your wishes, even
      though it may not be all you desire. I will not promise to give up my
      husband;&mdash;I will not promise never to see him, and never to write to
      him&mdash;but I will swear to you one thing that should completely put
      your fears and doubts of me at rest!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Both the King and Queen looked at her wonderingly;&mdash;a brighter, more
      delicate beauty seemed to invest her,&mdash;she stood very proudly
      upright, her small head lifted,&mdash;her rich hair glistening in the soft
      sunshine that streamed in subdued tints through the high stained-glass
      windows of the room,&mdash;her figure, slight and tall, was like that of
      the goddess dreamt of by Endymion.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are so unhappy already," she continued, turning to the Queen; "You
      have lost so much, and you need so much, that I should be sorry to add to
      your burden of grief! If I thought I could make you glad,&mdash;if I
      thought I could make you see the world through my eyes, with all the
      patient, loving human hearts about you, waiting for the sympathy you never
      give; I would come to you often, and try to find the warm pulse of you
      somewhere under all that splendour which you clothe yourself in, and which
      is as valueless to me as the dust on the common road! And if I could show
      <i>you</i>" and here she fixed her steadfast glance upon the King,&mdash;"where
      you might win friends instead of losing them,&mdash;if I could persuade
      you to look and see where the fires of Revolution are beginning to
      smoulder and kindle under your very Throne,&mdash;if I could bear messages
      from you of compassion and tenderness to all the disaffected and disloyal,
      I would ask you on my knees to let me be your daughter in affection, as I
      am by marriage; and I would unveil to you the secrets of your own kingdom,
      which is slowly but steadily rising against you! But you judge me wrongly&mdash;you
      estimate me falsely,&mdash;and where I might have given aid, your own
      misconception of me makes me useless! You consider me low-born and a mere
      peasant! How can you be sure of that?&mdash;for truly I do not know who I
      am, or where I came from. For aught I can tell, the storm was my father,
      and the sea my mother,&mdash;but my parents may as easily have been Royal!
      You judge me half-educated,&mdash;and wholly unworthy to be your son's
      wife. Will the ladies of your Court compete with me in learning? I am
      ready! What I hear of their attainments has not as yet commanded my
      respect or admiration,&mdash;and you yourself as King, do nothing to show
      that you care for either art or learning! I wonder, indeed, that you
      should even pause to consider whether your son's wife is educated or not!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Absolutely silent, the King kept his eyes upon her. He was experiencing a
      novel sensation which was altogether delightful to him, and more
      instructive than any essay or sermon. He, the ostensible ruler of the
      country, was face to face with a woman who had no fear of him,&mdash;no
      awe for his position,&mdash;no respect for his rank, but who simply spoke
      to him as though he had been any ordinary person. He saw a scarcely
      perceptible smile on his son's handsome features,&mdash;he saw that Von
      Glauben's eyes twinkled, despite his carefully preserved seriousness of
      demeanour, and he realized the almost absurd powerlessness of his
      authority in such an embarrassing position. The assumption of a mute
      contempt, such as was vaguely expressed by the Queen, appeared to him to
      be the best policy;&mdash;he therefore adopted that attitude, without
      however producing the least visible effect. Gloria's face, softly flushed
      with suppressed emotion, looked earnest and impassioned, but neither
      abashed nor afraid.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have read many histories of kings," she continued slowly; "Of their
      treacheries and cruelties; of their neglect of their people! Seldom have
      they been truly great! The few who are reported as wise, lived and reigned
      so many ages ago, that we cannot tell whether their virtues were indeed as
      admirable as described,&mdash;or whether their vices were not condoned by
      a too-partial historian. A Throne has no attraction for me! The only
      sorrow I have ever known in my life, is the discovery that the man I love
      best in the world is a king's son! Would to God he were poor and
      unrenowned as I thought him to be, when I married him!&mdash;for so we
      should always have been happy. But now I have to think for him as well as
      for myself;&mdash;his position is as hard as mine,&mdash;and we accept our
      fate as a trial of our love. Love cannot be forced,&mdash;it must root
      itself, and grow where it will. It has made us two as one;&mdash;one in
      thought,&mdash;one in hope,&mdash;one in faith! No earthly power can part
      us. You would marry him to another woman, and force him to commit a great
      sin 'for the good of the country'? I tell you, if you do that,&mdash;if
      any king or prince does that,&mdash;God's curse will surely fall upon the
      Throne, and all that do inherit it!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not raise her voice,&mdash;she spoke in low thrilling accents,
      without excitement, but with measured force and calm. Then she beckoned
      the Crown Prince to her side. He instantly obeyed her gesture. Taking him
      by the hand, she advanced a little, and with him confronted both the King
      and Queen.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hear me, your Majesties both!" she said in clear, firm accents; "And when
      you have heard, be satisfied as to 'the good of the country,' and let me
      depart to my own home in peace, away from all your crushing and miserable
      conventions. I take your son by the hand, and even as I swore my faith to
      him at the marriage altar, so I swear to you that he is free to follow his
      own inclination;&mdash;his law is mine,&mdash;his will my pleasure,&mdash;and
      in everything I shall obey him, save in this one decree, which I make for
      myself in your Majesties' sovereign presence&mdash;that never, so help me
      God, will I claim or share my husband's rank as Crown Prince, or set foot
      within this palace, which is his home, again, till a greater voice than
      that of any king,&mdash;the voice of the Nation itself, calls upon me to
      do so!"
    </p>
    <p>
      This proud declaration was entirely unexpected; and both the King and
      Queen regarded the beautiful speaker in undisguised amazement. She, gently
      dropping the Prince's hand, met their eyes with a wistful pathos in her
      own.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will that satisfy you?" she asked, a slight tremor shaking her voice as
      she put the question.
    </p>
    <p>
      The King at once advanced, and now spoke frankly, and without any
      ceremony.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Assuredly! You are a brave girl! True to your love, and true to the
      country at one and the same time! But while I accept your vow, let me warn
      you not to indulge in any lurking hope or feeling that the Nation will
      ever recognize your marriage. Your own willingly-taken oath at this moment
      practically makes it null and void, so far as the State is concerned;&mdash;but
      perhaps it strengthens it as a bond of&mdash;youthful passion!"
    </p>
    <p>
      An open admiration flashed in his bold fine eyes as he spoke,&mdash;and
      Gloria grew pale. With an involuntary movement she turned towards the
      Queen.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You&mdash;Madam&mdash;you&mdash;Ah! No,&mdash;not you!&mdash;you are
      cruel!&mdash;you have not a woman's heart! My love&mdash;my husband!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The Prince was at once beside her, and she clung to him trembling.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Take me away!" she whispered; "Take me away altogether&mdash;this place
      stifles me!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He caught her in his strong young arms, and was about to lead her to the
      door, when she suddenly appeared to remember something, and releasing
      herself from his clasp, put him away from her with a faint smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, dearest! You must stay here;&mdash;stay here and make your father and
      mother understand all that I have said. Tell them I mean to keep my vow.
      You know how thoroughly I mean it! The Professor will take me home!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the Queen moved, and came towards her with her usual slow noiseless
      grace.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let me thank you!" she said, with an air of gracious condescension; "You
      are a very good girl, and I am sure you will keep your word! You are so
      beautiful that you are bound to do well; and I hope your future life will
      be a happy one!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hope so, Madam!" replied Gloria slowly; "I think it will! If it is not
      happier than yours, I shall indeed be unfortunate!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The Queen drew back, offended; but the King, who had been whispering aside
      to Von Glauben, now approached and said kindly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You must not go away, my child, without some token of our regard. Wear
      this for Our sake!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He offered her a chain of gold bearing a simple yet exquisitely designed
      pendant of choice pearls. Her face crimsoned, and she pushed it
      disdainfully aside.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Keep it, Sir, for those whose love and faith can be purchased with
      jewelled toys! Mine cannot! You mean kindly no doubt,&mdash;but a gift
      from you is an offence, not an honour! Fare-you-well!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Another moment and she was gone. Von Glauben, at a sign from the King,
      hastily followed her. Prince Humphry, who had remained almost entirely
      mute during the scene, now stood with folded arms opposite his Royal
      parents, still silent and rigid. The King watched him for a minute or two&mdash;then
      laid a hand gently on his arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We do not blame you over-much, Humphry!" he said; "She is a beautiful
      creature, and more intelligent than I had imagined. Moreover she has great
      calmness, as well as courage."
    </p>
    <p>
      Still the Prince said nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are satisfied, Madam, I presume?" went on the King addressing his
      Consort;&mdash;"The girl could hardly make a more earnest vow of
      abnegation than she has done. And when Humphry has travelled for a year
      and seen other lands, other manners, and other faces, we may look upon
      this boyish incident in his career as finally closed. I think both you and
      I can rest assured that there will be no further cause for anxiety?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He put the question carelessly. The Queen bent her head in acquiescence,
      but her eyes were fixed upon her son, who still said nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We have not received any promise from Humphry himself," she said;
      "Apparently he is not disposed to take a similar oath of loyalty!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Truly, Madam, you judge me rightly for once!" said the Prince, quietly;
      "I am certainly not disposed to do anything but to be master of my own
      thoughts and actions."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Remain so, Humphry, by all means!" said the King indulgently. "The
      present circumstances being so far favourable, we exact nothing more from
      you. Love will be love, and passion must have its way with boys of your
      age. I impose no further restriction upon you. The girl's own word is to
      me sufficient bond for the preservation of your high position. All young
      men have their little secret love-affairs; we shall not blame you for
      yours now, seeing, as we do, the satisfactory end of it in sight! But I
      fear we are detaining you!" This with elaborate politeness. "If you wish
      to follow your fair <i>inamorata</i>, the way is clear! You may retire!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Without any haste, but with formal military stiffness the Prince saluted,&mdash;and
      turning slowly on his heel, left the presence-chamber. Alone, the King and
      his beautiful Queen-Consort looked questioningly at one another.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What think you, Madam, of the heroine of this strange love-story?" he
      asked with a touch of bitterness in his voice. "Does it not strike you
      that even in this arid world of much deception, there may be after all
      such a thing as innocence?&mdash;such a treasure as true and trusting
      love? Were not the eyes of this girl Gloria, when lifted to your face,
      something like the eyes of a child who has just said its prayers to God,&mdash;who
      fears nothing and loves all? Yet I doubt whether you were moved!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Were you?" she asked indifferently, yet with a strange fluttering at her
      heart, which she could not herself comprehend.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was!" he answered. "I confess it! I was profoundly touched to see a
      girl of such beauty and innocence confront us here, with no other shield
      against our formal and ridiculous conventionalities, save the pure
      strength of her own love for Humphry, and her complete trust in him. It is
      easy to see that her life hangs on his will; it is not so much her with
      whom we have to deal, as with him. What he says, she will evidently obey.
      If he tells her he has ceased to love her, she will die quite
      uncomplainingly; but so long as he does love her, she will live, and
      expand in beauty and intelligence on that love alone; and you may be
      assured, Madam, that in that case, he will never wed another woman! Nor
      could I possibly blame him, for he is bound to find all&mdash;or most
      women inferior to her!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She regarded him wonderingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your admiration of her is keen, Sir!" she said, amazed to find herself
      somewhat irritated. "Perhaps if she were not morganatically your
      daughter-in-law, you might be your son's rival?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned upon her indignantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Madam, the days were, when you, as my wife, had it in your power to admit
      no rivals to the kingdom of your own beauty! Since then, I confess, you
      have had many! But they have been worthless rivals all,&mdash;crazed with
      their own vanity and greed, and empty of truth and honour. A month or two
      before I came to the Throne, I was beginning to think that women were
      viler than vermin,&mdash;I had grown utterly weary of their beauty,&mdash;weary&mdash;ay,
      sick to death of their alluring eyes, sensual lips, and too freely-offered
      caresses; the uncomely, hard-worked woman, earning bread for her
      half-starved children, seemed the only kind of feminine creature for which
      I could have any respect&mdash;but now&mdash;I am learning that there <i>are</i>
      good women who are fair to see,&mdash;women who have hearts to love and
      suffer, and who are true&mdash;ay&mdash;true as the sun in heaven to the
      one man they worship!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A man who is generally quite unworthy of them!" said the Queen with a
      chill laugh; "Your eloquence, Sir, is very touching, and no doubt leads
      further than I care to penetrate! The girl Gloria is certainly beautiful,
      and no doubt very innocent and true at present,&mdash;but when Humphry
      tires of her, as he surely will, for all men quickly tire of those that
      love them best,&mdash;she will no doubt sink into the ordinary ways of
      obtaining consolation. I know little concerning these amazingly good women
      you speak of; and nothing concerning good men! But I quite agree with you
      that many women are to be admired for their hard work. You see when once
      they do begin to work, men generally keep them at it!" She gathered up her
      rich train on one arm, and prepared to leave the apartment. "If you
      think," she continued, "as you now say, that Humphry will never change his
      present sentiments, and never marry any other woman, the girl's oath is a
      mere farce and of no avail!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "On the contrary, it is of much avail," said the King, "for she has sworn
      before us both never to claim any right to share in Humphry's position,
      till the nation itself asks her to do so. Now as the nation will never
      know of the marriage at all, the 'call' will not be forthcoming."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Queen paused in the act of turning away.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you were to die," she said; "Humphry would be King. And as King, he is
      quite capable of making Gloria Queen!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at her very strangely.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Madam, in the event of my death, all things are possible!" he said; "A
      dying Sovereignty may give birth to a Republic!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The Queen smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, it is the most popular form of government nowadays," she responded,
      carelessly moving slowly towards the door; "And perhaps the most
      satisfactory. I think if I were not a Queen, I should be a republican!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And I, if I were not a King," he responded, "should be a Socialist! Such
      are the strange contradictions of human nature! Permit me!" He opened the
      door of the room for her to pass out,&mdash;and as she did so, she looked
      up full in his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you still interested in your new form of amusement?" she said; "And
      do you still expose yourself to danger and death?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He bowed assent.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Still am I a fool in a new course of folly, Madam!" he answered with a
      smile, and a half sigh. "So many of my brother monarchs are wadded round
      like peaches in wool, with precautions for their safety, lest they bruise
      at a touch, that I assure you I take the chances of danger and death as
      exhilarating sport, compared to their guarded condition. But it is very
      good of you to assume such a gracious solicitude for my safety!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Assume?" she said. Her voice had a slight tremor in it,&mdash;her eyes
      looked soft and suffused with something like tears. Then, with her usual
      stately grace, she saluted him, and passed out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Struck at the unwonted expression in her face, he stood for a moment
      amazed. Then he gave vent to a low bitter laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How strange it would be if she should love me now!" he murmured. "But&mdash;after
      all these years&mdash;too late! Too late!"
    </p>
    <p>
      That night before the King retired to rest, Professor von Glauben reported
      himself and his duty to his Majesty in the privacy of his own apartments.
      He had, he stated, accompanied Gloria back to her home in The Islands;
      and, he added somewhat hesitatingly, the Crown Prince had returned with
      her, and had there remained. He, the Professor, had left them together,
      being commanded by the Prince so to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      The King received this information with perfect equanimity.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The boy must have his way for the present," he said. "His passion will
      soon exhaust itself. All passion exhausts itself sooner or&mdash;later!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That depends very much on the depth or shallowness of its source, Sir,"
      replied the Professor.
    </p>
    <p>
      "True! But a boy!&mdash;a mere infant in experience! What can he know of
      the depths in the heart and soul! Now a man of my age&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      He broke off abruptly, seeing Von Glauben's eyes fixed steadfastly upon
      him, and the colour deepened in his cheek. Then he gave a slight laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I tell you, Von Glauben, this little love-affair&mdash;this absurd
      toy-marriage is not worth thinking about. Humphry leaves the country at
      the end of this month,&mdash;he will remain absent a year,&mdash;and at
      the expiration of that time we shall marry him in good earnest to a
      royally-born bride. Meanwhile, let us not trouble ourselves about this
      sentimental episode, which is so rapidly drawing to its close."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Professor bowed respectfully and retired. But not to sleep. He had a
      glowing picture before his eyes,&mdash;a picture he could not forget, of
      the Crown Prince and Gloria standing with arms entwined about each other
      under the rose-covered porch of Ronsard's cottage saying "Good-night" to
      him, while Ronsard himself, his tranquillity completely restored, and his
      former fears at rest, warmly shook his hand, and with a curious mingling
      of pride and deference thanked him for all his friendship&mdash;'all his
      goodness!'
    </p>
    <p>
      "And no goodness at all is mine," said the meditative Professor, "save
      that of being as honest as I can to both sides! But there is some change
      in the situation which I do not quite understand. There is some new plan
      on foot I would swear! The Prince was too triumphant&mdash;Gloria too
      happy&mdash;Ronsard too satisfied! There is something in the wind!&mdash;but
      I cannot make out what it is!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He pondered uneasily for a part of the night, reflecting that when he had
      returned from The Islands in the King's yacht, he had met the Prince's own
      private vessel on her way thither, gliding over the waves, a mere ghostly
      bunch of white sails in the glimmering moon. He had concluded that it was
      under orders to embark the Prince for home again in the morning; and yet,
      though this was a perfectly natural and probable surmise, he had been
      unable to rid himself altogether of a doubtful presentiment, to which he
      could give no name. By degrees, he fell into an uneasy slumber, in which
      he had many incompleted dreams,&mdash;one of which was that he found
      himself all alone on the wide ocean which stretched for thousands of miles
      beyond The Islands,&mdash;alone in a small boat, endeavouring to row it
      towards the great Southern Continent that lay afar off in the invisible
      distance,&mdash;where few but the most adventurous travellers ever cared
      to wander. And as he pulled with weak, ineffectual oars against the mighty
      weight of the rolling billows, he thought he heard the words of an old
      Irish song which he remembered having listened to, when as quite a young
      man he had paid his first and last visit to the misty and romantic shores
      of Britain.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                "Come o'er the sea
              <i>Cushla ma chree</i>!&mdash;
         Mine through sunshine, storm and snows!&mdash;
                 Seasons may roll,
                 But the true soul,
         Burns the same wherever it goes;
  Let fate frown on, so we love and part not,
  'T is life where thou art, 't is death where thou art not!
                 Then come o'er the sea,
              <i>Cushla ma chree</i>!
           Mine wherever the wild wind blows!"
</pre>
    <p>
      Then waking with a violent start, he wondered what set of brain-cells had
      been stirred to reproduce rhymes that he had, or so he deemed, long ago
      forgotten. And still musing, he almost mechanically went on with the wild
      ditty.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
            "Was not the sea
            Made for the free,
  Land for Courts and chains alone!&mdash;
            Here we are slaves,
            But on the waves,
  Love and liberty are our own!"
</pre>
    <p>
      "This will never do!" he exclaimed, leaping from his bed; "I am becoming a
      mere driveller with advancing age!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He went to the window and looked out. It was about six o'clock in the
      morning,&mdash;the sun was shining brightly into his room. Before him lay
      the sea, calm as a lake, and clear-sparkling as a diamond;&mdash;not a
      boat was in sight;&mdash;not a single white sail on the distant horizon.
      And in the freshness and stillness of the breaking day, the world looked
      but just newly created.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How we fret and fume in our little span of life!" he murmured. "A few
      years hence, and for us all the troubles which we make for ourselves will
      be ended! But the sun and the sea will shine on just the same&mdash;and
      Love, the supremest power on earth, will still govern mankind, when
      thrones and kings and empires are no more!"
    </p>
    <p>
      His thoughts were destined to bear quick fruition. The morning deepened
      into noon&mdash;and at that hour a sealed dispatch brought by a sailor,
      who gave no name and who departed as soon as he had delivered his packet,
      was handed to the King. It was from the Crown Prince, and ran briefly
      thus:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "At your command, Sir, and by my own desire, I have left the country over
      which you hold your sovereign dominion. Whither I travel, and how, is my
      own affair. I shall return no more <i>till the Nation demands my service</i>,&mdash;whereof
      I shall doubtless hear should such a contingency ever arise. I leave you
      to deal with the situation as seems best to your good pleasure and that of
      the Government,&mdash;but the life God has given me can only be lived
      once, and to Him alone am I responsible for it. I am resolved therefore to
      live it to my own liking,&mdash;in honesty, faith and freedom. In
      accordance with this determination, Gloria, my wife, as in her sworn
      marriage-duty bound, goes with me."
    </p>
    <p>
      For one moment the King stood transfixed and astounded; a cloud of anger
      darkened his brows. Crumpling up the document in his hand, he was about to
      fling it from him in a fury. What! This mere boy and girl had baffled the
      authority of a king! Anon, his anger cooled&mdash;his countenance cleared.
      Smoothing the paper out he read its contents again,&mdash;then smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well! Humphry has something of me in him after all!" he said. "He is not
      entirely his mother! He has a heart,&mdash;a will, and a conscience,&mdash;all
      three generally lacking to sons of kings! Let me be honest with myself! If
      he had given way to me, I should have despised him!&mdash;'but for Love's
      sake he has opposed me; and by my soul!&mdash;I respect him!"

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXIII. &mdash; THE KING'S DEFENDER
    </h2>
    <p>
      Rumour, we are told, has a million tongues, and they were soon all at
      work, wagging out the news of the Crown Prince's mysterious departure.
      Each tongue told a different story, and none of the stories tallied. No
      information was to be obtained at Court. There nothing was said, but that
      the Prince, disliking the formal ceremony of a public departure, had
      privately set sail in his own yacht for his projected tour round the
      world. Nobody believed this; and the general impression soon gained ground
      that the young man had fallen into disgrace with his Royal parents, and
      had been sent away for a time till he should recognize the enormity of his
      youthful indiscretions.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sent away&mdash;you understand!" said the society gossips; "To avoid
      further scandal!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The Prince's younger brothers, Rupert and Cyprian, were often plied with
      questions by their intimates, but knowing nothing, and truly caring less,
      they could give no explanation. Neither King nor Queen spoke a word on the
      subject; and Sir Roger de Launay, astonished and perplexed beyond measure
      as he was at this turn in affairs, dared not put any questions even to his
      friend Professor von Glauben who, as soon as the news of the Prince's
      departure was known, resolutely declined to speak, so he said, "on what
      did not concern him." Gradually, however, this excitement partially
      subsided to give place to other forms of social commotion, which beginning
      in trifles, swiftly expanded to larger and more serious development. The
      first of these was the sudden rise of a newspaper which had for many years
      subsisted with the greatest difficulty in opposition to the many journals
      governed by David Jost. It happened in this manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      Several leading articles written in favour of a Jesuit settlement in the
      country, had appeared constantly in Jost's largest and most widely
      circulated newspaper, and the last of these 'leaders,' had concluded with
      the assertion that though his Majesty, the King, had at first refused the
      portion of Crown-lands needed by the Society for building, he had now
      'graciously' re-considered the situation, and had been pleased to revoke
      his previous decision. Whereat, the very next morning the rival 'daily'
      had leaped into prominence by merely two headlines:
    </p>
    <h3>
      THE JESUIT SETTLEMENT STATEMENT BY HIS MAJESTY THE KING.
    </h3>
    <p>
      And there, plainly set forth, was the Royal and authoritative refusal to
      grant the lands required, 'Because of the earnest petition of our loving
      subjects against the said grant,'&mdash;and till 'our loving subjects''
      objections were removed, the lands would be withheld. This public
      announcement signed by the King in person, created the most extraordinary
      sensation throughout the whole country. It was the one topic at every
      social meeting; it was the one subject of every sermon. Preachers stormed
      and harangued in every pulpit, and Monsignor Del Fortis, lifting up his
      harsh raucous voice in the Cathedral itself, addressed an enormous
      congregation one Sunday morning on the matter, and denounced the King, the
      Queen, and the mysteriously-departed Crown Prince in the most orthodox
      Christian manner, commending them to the flames of hell, and the mercy of
      a loving God at one and the same moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, the newspaper that had been permitted to publish the King's
      statement got its circulation up by tens of thousands, the more so as
      certain brilliant and fiery articles on the political situation began to
      appear therein signed by one Pasquin Leroy, a stranger to the reading
      public, but in whom the spirit of a modern 'Junius' appeared to have
      entered for the purpose of warning, threatening and commanding. A scathing
      and audacious attack upon Carl Pérousse, Secretary of State, in which the
      small darts of satire flew further than the sharpest arrows of assertion,
      was among the first of these, and Pérousse himself, maddened like a bull
      at the first prick of the toreador, by the stinging truths the writer
      uttered, or rather suggested, lost no time in summoning General Bernhoff
      to a second interview.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did I not tell you," he said, pointing to the signature at the end of the
      offending article, "to 'shadow' that man, and arrest him as a common spy?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Bernhoff bowed stiffly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You did! But it is difficult to arrest one who is not capable of being
      arrested. I must be provided first with proofs of his guilt; and I must
      also obtain the King's order."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Proofs should be easy enough for you to obtain," said Pérousse fiercely;
      "And the King will sign any warrant he is told. At least, you can surely
      find this rascal out?&mdash;where he lives, and what are his means of
      subsistence?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "If he were here, I could," responded Bernhoff calmly; "I have made all
      the necessary preliminary enquiries. The man is a gentleman of
      considerable wealth. He writes for his own amusement, and&mdash;from a
      distance. I advise you&mdash;" and here the General held up an
      obstinate-looking finger of warning; "I advise you, I say, to let him
      alone! I can find no proof whatever that he is a spy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Proof! I can give you enough&mdash;" began Pérousse hotly, then paused in
      confusion. For what could he truly say? If he told the Chief of Police
      that this Pasquin Leroy was believed to have counterfeited the Prime
      Minister's signet, in order to obtain an interview with David Jost, why
      then the Chief of Police would be informed once and for all that the Prime
      Minister was in confidential communication with the Jew-proprietor of a
      stock-jobbing newspaper! And that would never do! It would, at the least,
      be impolitic. Inwardly chafing with annoyance, he assumed an outward air
      of conscientious gravity.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will regret it, General, I think, if you do not follow out my
      suggestions respecting this man," he said coldly; "He is writing for the
      press in a strain which is plainly directed against the Government. Of
      course we statesmen pay little or no heed to modern journalism, but the
      King, having taken the unusual, and as I consider it, unwise step of
      proclaiming certain of his intentions in a newspaper which was, until his
      patronage, obscure and unsuccessful, the public attention has been
      suddenly turned towards this particular journal; and what is written
      therein may possibly influence the masses as it would not have done a few
      weeks ago."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I quite believe that!" said Bernhoff tersely; "But I cannot arrest a man
      for writing clever things. Literary talent is no proof of dishonesty."
    </p>
    <p>
      Pérousse looked at him sharply. But there was no satire in Bernhoff's
      fixed and glassy eye, and no expression whatever in his woodenly-composed
      countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We entertain different opinions on the matter, it is evident!" he said;
      "You will at least grant that if he cannot be arrested, he can be
      carefully watched?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He <i>is</i> carefully watched!" replied Bernhoff; "That is to say, as
      far as <i>I</i> can watch him!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good!" and Pérousse smiled, somewhat relieved. "Then on the first
      suspicion of a treasonable act&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall arrest him&mdash;in the King's name, when the King signs the
      warrant," said Bernhoff; "But he is one of Sergius Thord's followers, and
      at the present juncture it might be unwise to touch any member of that
      particularly inflammable body."
    </p>
    <p>
      Pérousse frowned.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sergius Thord ought to have been hanged or shot years ago&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then why did not you hang or shoot him?" enquired Bernhoff.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was not in office."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why do you not hang or shoot him now?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why? Because&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because," interrupted Bernhoff, again lifting his grim warning finger;
      "If you did, the city would be in a tumult and more than half the soldiery
      would be on the side of the mob! By way of warning, M. Pérousse, I may as
      well tell you frankly, on the authority of my position as Head of the
      Police, that the Government are on the edge of a dangerous situation!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Pérousse looked contemptuous.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Every Government in the world is on the edge of a dangerous situation
      nowadays!" he retorted;&mdash;"But any Government that yields to the mob
      proves itself a mere ministry of cowardice."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yet the mob often wins,&mdash;not only by excess of numbers, but by sheer
      force of&mdash;honesty!"&mdash;said Bernhoff sententiously; "It has been
      known to sweep away, and re-make political constitutions before now."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It has,"&mdash;agreed Pérousse, drawing pens and paper towards him, and
      feigning to be busily occupied in the commencement of a letter&mdash;"But
      it will not indulge itself in such amusements during <i>my</i> time!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah! I wonder how long your time will last!" muttered Bernhoff to himself
      as he withdrew&mdash;"Six months or six days? I would not bet on the
      longer period!"
    </p>
    <p>
      In good truth there was considerable reason for the General's dubious
      outlook on affairs. A political storm was brewing. A heavy tidal wave of
      discontent was sweeping the masses of the people stormily against the
      rocks of existing authority, and loud and bitter and incessant were the
      complaints on all sides against the increased taxation levied upon every
      rate-payer. Fiercest of all was the clamour made by the poor at the
      increasing price of bread, the chief necessity of life; for the imposition
      of a heavy duty upon wheat and other cereals had made the common loaf of
      the peasant's daily fare almost an article of luxury. Stormy meetings were
      held in every quarter of the city,&mdash;protests were drawn up and signed
      by thousands,&mdash;endless petitions were handed to the King,&mdash;but
      no practical result came from these. His Majesty was 'graciously pleased'
      to seem blind, deaf and wholly indifferent to the agitated condition of
      his subjects. Now and then a Government orator would mount the political
      rostrum and talk 'patriotism' for an hour or so, to a more or less sullen
      audience, informing them with much high-flown eloquence that, by
      responding to the Governmental demands and supporting the Governmental
      measures, they were strengthening the resources of the country and
      completing the efficiency of both Army and Navy; but somehow, his
      hydraulic efforts at rousing the popular enthusiasm failed of effect.
      Whereas, whenever Sergius Thord spoke, thousands of throats roared
      acclamation,&mdash;and the very sight of Lotys passing quietly down the
      poorer thoroughfares of the city was sufficient to bring out groups of men
      and women to their doors, waving their hands to her, sending her wild
      kisses,&mdash;and almost kneeling before her in an ecstasy of trust and
      adoration. Thord himself perceived that the situation was rapidly reaching
      a climax, and quietly prepared himself to meet and cope with it. Two of
      the monthly business meetings of the Revolutionary Committee had been held
      since that on which Pasquin Leroy and his two friends had been enrolled as
      members of the Brotherhood, and at the last of these, Thord took Leroy
      into his full confidence, and gave him all the secret clues of the
      Revolutionary organization which honeycombed the metropolis from end to
      end. He had trusted the man in many ways and found him honest. One
      trifling proof of this was perhaps the main reason of Thord's further
      reliance upon him; he had fulfilled his half-suggested promise to bring
      the sunshine of prosperity into the hard-working, and more or less sordid
      life of the little dancing-girl, Pequita. She had been sent for one
      morning by the manager of the Royal Opera, who having seen the ease,
      grace, and dexterity of her performance, forthwith engaged her for the
      entire season at a salary which when named to the amazed child, seemed
      like a veritable shower of gold tumbling by rare chance out of the lap of
      Dame Fortune. The manager was a curt, cold business man, and she was
      afraid to ask him any questions, for when the words&mdash;"I am sure a
      kind friend has spoken to you of me&mdash;" came timidly from her lips, he
      had shut up her confidence at once by the brief answer&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "No. You are mistaken. We accept no personal recommendations. We only
      employ proved talent!"
    </p>
    <p>
      All the same Pequita felt sure that she owed the sudden lifting of her own
      and her father's daily burden of life, to the unforgetting care and
      intercession of Leroy. Lotys was equally convinced of the same, and both
      she and Sergius Thord highly appreciated their new associate's unobtrusive
      way of doing good, as it were, by stealth. Pequita's exquisite grace and
      agility had made her at once the fashion; the Opera was crowded nightly to
      see the 'wonderful child-dancer'; and valuable gifts and costly jewels
      were showered upon her, all of which she brought to Lotys, who advised her
      how to dispose of them best, and put by the money for the comfort and care
      of her father in the event of sickness, or the advance of age. Flattered
      and petted by the great world as she now was, Pequita never lost her head
      in the whirl of gay splendour, but remained the same child-like, loving
      little creature,&mdash;her one idol her father,&mdash;her only confidante,
      Lotys, whose gentle admonitions and constant watchfulness saved her from
      many a dangerous pitfall. As yet, she had not attained the wish she had
      expressed, to dance before the King,&mdash;but she was told that at any
      time his Majesty might visit the Opera, and that steps would be taken to
      induce him to do so for the special purpose of witnessing her performance.
      So with this half promise she was fain to be content, and to bear with the
      laughing taunts of her 'Revolutionary' friends, who constantly teased her
      and called her 'little traitor' because she sought the Royal favour.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another event, which was correctly or incorrectly traced to Leroy's
      silently working influence, was the sudden meteoric blaze of Paul Zouche
      into fame. How it happened, no one knew;&mdash;and <i>why</i> it happened
      was still more of a mystery, because by all its own tenets and traditions
      the social world ought to have set itself dead against the 'Psalm of
      Revolution,'&mdash;the title of the book of poems which created such an
      amazing stir. But somehow, it got whispered about that the King had
      attempted to 'patronise' the poet, and that the poet had very indignantly
      resented the offered Royal condescension. Whereat, by degrees, there arose
      in society circles a murmur of wonder at the poet's 'pluck,' wonder that
      deepened into admiration, with incessant demand for his book,&mdash;and
      admiration soon expanded, with the aid of the book, into a complete
      "craze." Zouche's name was on every lip; invitations to great houses
      reached him every week;&mdash;his poems began to sell by thousands; yet
      with all this, the obstinacy of his erratic nature asserted itself as
      usual, undiminished, and Zouche withdrew from the shower of praise like a
      snail into its shell,&mdash;answered none of the flattering requests for
      'the pleasure of his company,' and handed whatever money he made by his
      poems over to the funds of the Revolutionary Committee, only accepting as
      much out of it as would pay for his clothes, food, lodging, and&mdash;drink!
      But the more he turned his back on Fame, the more hotly it pursued him;&mdash;his
      very churlishness was talked about as something remarkable and admirable,&mdash;and
      when it was suggested that he was fonder of strong liquor than was
      altogether seemly, people smiled and nodded at each other pleasantly,
      tapped their foreheads meaningly and murmured: 'Genius! Genius!' as though
      that were a quality allied of divine necessity to alcoholism.
    </p>
    <p>
      These two things,&mdash;the advent of a new dancer at the Opera, and the
      fame of Paul Zouche, were the chief topics of 'Society' outside its own
      tawdry personal concern; but under all the light froth and spume of the
      pleasure-seeking, pleasure-loving whirl of fashion, a fierce tempest was
      rising, and the first whistlings of the wind of revolt were already
      beginning to pierce through the keyholes and crannies of the stately
      building allotted to the business of Government;&mdash;so much so indeed
      that one terrible night, all unexpectedly, a huge mob, some twenty
      thousand strong, surrounded it, armed with every conceivable weapon from
      muskets to pickaxes, and shouted with horrid din for 'Bread and Justice!'&mdash;these
      being considered co-equal in the bewildered mind of the excited multitude.
      Likewise did they scream with protrusive energy: 'Give us back our lost
      Trades!' being fully aware, despite their delirium, that these said 'lost
      Trades' were being sold off into 'Trusts,' wherein Ministers themselves
      held considerable shares, A two-sided clamour was also made for 'The King!
      The King!' one side appealing, the other menacing,&mdash;the latter under
      the belief that his Majesty equally had 'shares' in the bartered Trades,&mdash;the
      former in the hope that the country's Honour might still be saved with the
      help of their visible Head.
    </p>
    <p>
      Much difficulty was experienced in clearing this surging throng of
      indignant humanity, for though the soldiery were called out to effect the
      work, they were more than half-hearted in their business, having
      considerable grievances of their own to avenge,&mdash;and when ordered to
      fire on the people, flatly refused to do so. Two persons however succeeded
      at last in calming and quelling the tumult. One was Sergius Thord,&mdash;the
      other Lotys. Carl Pérousse, seized with an access of 'nerves' within the
      cushioned luxury of his own private room in the recesses of the Government
      buildings, from whence he had watched the demonstration, peered from one
      of the windows, and saw one half of the huge mob melt swiftly away under
      the command of a tall, majestic-looking creature, whose massive form and
      leonine head appeared Ajax-like above the throng; and he watched the other
      half turn round in brisk order, like a well-drilled army, and march off,
      singing loudly and lustily, headed by a woman carried shoulder-high before
      them, whose white robes gleamed like a flag of truce in the glare of the
      torches blazing around her;&mdash;and to his utter amazement, fear and
      disgust, he heard the very soldiers shouting her name: "Lotys! Lotys!"
      with ever-increasing and thunderous plaudits of admiration and homage.
      Often and often had he heard that name,&mdash;often and often had he
      dismissed it from his thoughts with light masculine contempt. Often, too,
      had it come to the ears of his colleague the Premier, who as has been
      shown, even in intimate converse with his own private secretary, feigned
      complete ignorance of it. But it is well understood that politicians
      generally, and diplomatists always, assume to have no knowledge whatever
      concerning those persons of whom they are most afraid. Yet just now it was
      unpleasantly possible that "the stone which the builders rejected" might
      indirectly be the means of crushing the Ministry, and reorganizing the
      affairs of the country. His meditations on this occasion were interrupted
      by a touch on the shoulder from behind, and, looking up, he saw the
      Marquis de Lutera.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Almost a riot!" he said, forcing a pale smile,&mdash;"But not quite!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Say, rather, almost a revolution!" retorted the Marquis brusquely;&mdash;"Jesting
      is out of place. We are on the brink of a very serious disaster! The
      people are roused. To-night they threatened to burn down these buildings
      over our heads,&mdash;to sack and destroy the King's Palace. The Socialist
      leader, Thord, alone saved the situation."
    </p>
    <p>
      "With the aid of his mistress?" suggested Pérousse with a sneer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You mean the woman they call Lotys? I am not aware that she is his
      mistress. I should rather doubt it. The people would not make such a saint
      of her if she were. At any rate, whatever else she may be, she is
      certainly dangerous;&mdash;and in a country less free than ours would be
      placed under arrest. I must confess I never believed in her 'vogue' with
      the masses, until to-night."
    </p>
    <p>
      Pérousse was silent. The great square in front of the Government buildings
      was now deserted,&mdash;save for the police and soldiery on guard; but
      away in the distance could still be heard faint echoes of singing and
      cheering from the broken-up sections of the crowd that had lately
      disturbed the peace.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you seen the King lately?" enquired Lutera presently.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No."
    </p>
    <p>
      "By his absolute 'veto' against our propositions at the last Cabinet
      Council, the impending war which would have been so useful to us, has been
      quashed in embryo," went on the Premier with a frown;&mdash;"This of
      course you know! And he has the right to exercise his veto if he likes.
      But I scarcely expected you after all you said, to take the matter so
      easily!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Pérousse smiled, and shrugged his shoulders deprecatingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "However," continued the Marquis with latent contempt in his tone;&mdash;"I
      now quite understand your complacent attitude! You have simply turned your
      'Army Supplies Contract' into a 'Trust' Combine with other nations,&mdash;so
      you will not lose, but rather gain by the transaction!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I never intended to lose!" said Pérousse calmly; "I am not troubled with
      scruples. One form of trade is as good as another. The prime object of
      life nowadays is to make money!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Lutera looked at him, but said nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "To amalgamate all the steel industries into one international Union, and
      get as many shares myself in the combine is not at all an unwise project,"
      went on Pérousse,&mdash;"For if our country is not to fight, other
      countries will;&mdash;and they will require guns and swords and all such
      accoutrements of war. Why should we not satisfy the demand and pocket the
      cash?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Still the Marquis looked at him steadily.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you aware,"&mdash;he asked at last, "that Jost, to save his 'press'
      prestige, has turned informer against you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Pérousse sprang up, white with fury.
    </p>
    <p>
      "By Heaven, if he has dared!&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is no 'if' in the case"&mdash;said Lutera very coldly&mdash;"He
      has, as he himself says, 'done his duty.' You must be pretty well
      cognisant of what a Jew's notions of 'duty' are! They can be summed up in
      one sentence;&mdash;'to save his own pocket.' Jost is driven to fury and
      desperation by the sudden success of the rival newspaper, which has been
      so prominently favoured by the King. The shares in his own journalistic
      concerns are going down rapidly, and he is determined&mdash;naturally
      enough&mdash;to take care of himself before anyone else. He has sold out
      of every company with which you have been, or are associated&mdash;and has&mdash;so
      I understand,&mdash;sent a complete list of your proposed financial
      'deals,' investments and other 'stock' to&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      He paused.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well!" exclaimed Pérousse irascibly&mdash;"To whom?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "To those whom it may concern,"&mdash;replied Lutera evasively&mdash;"I
      really can give you no exact information. I have said enough by way of
      warning!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Pérousse looked at him heedfully, and what he saw in that dark brooding
      face was not of a quieting or satisfactory nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are as deeply involved as I am&mdash;" he began.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pardon!" and the Marquis drew himself up with some dignity&mdash;"I <i>was</i>
      involved;&mdash;I am not now. I have also taken care of myself! I may have
      been misled, but I shall let no one suffer for my errors. I have sent in
      my resignation."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Fool!" ejaculated Pérousse, forgetting all courtesy in the sudden access
      of rage that took possession of him at these words;&mdash;"Fool, I say! At
      the very moment when you ought to stick to the ship, you desert it!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are <i>you</i> not ready to run to the helm?" enquired Lutera with a
      satiric smile; "Surely you can have no doubt but that his Majesty will
      command you to take office!"
    </p>
    <p>
      With this, he turned on his heel, and left his colleague to a space of
      very disagreeable meditation. For the first time in his bold and
      unscrupulous career, Pérousse found himself in an awkward position. If it
      were indeed true that Jost and Lutera had thrown up the game, especially
      Jost, then he, Pérousse, was lost. He had made of Jost, not only a tool,
      but a confidant. He had used him, and his great leading newspaper for his
      own political and financial purposes. He had entrusted him with State
      secrets, in order to speculate thereon in all the money-markets of the
      world. He had induced him to approach the Premier with crafty promises of
      support, and to inveigle him by insidious degrees into the same
      dishonourable financial 'deal.' So that if this one man,&mdash;this fat,
      unscrupulous turncoat of a Jew,&mdash;chose to speak out, he, Carl
      Pérousse, Secretary of State, would be the most disgraced and ruined
      Minister that ever attempted to defraud a nation! His brows grew moist
      with fever-heat, and his tongue parched, with the dry thirst of fear, as
      the gravity of the situation was gradually borne in upon him. He began to
      calculate contingencies and possibilities of escape from the toils that
      seemed closing around him,&mdash;and much to his irritation and
      embarrassment, he found that most of the ways leading out of difficulty
      pointed first of all to,&mdash;the King.
    </p>
    <p>
      The King! The very personage whom he had called a Dummy, only bound to do
      as he was told! And now, if he could only persuade the King that he,&mdash;the
      poor Secretary of State,&mdash;was a deeply-injured man, whose life's
      effort had been solely directed towards 'the good of the country,' yet who
      nevertheless was cruelly wronged and calumniated by his enemies, all might
      yet be well.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Were he only like other monarchs whom I know," he reflected. "I could
      have easily involved him in the Trades deal! Then the press could have
      been silenced, and the public fooled. With five or six hundred thousand
      shares in the biggest concerns, he would have been compelled to work under
      me for the amalgamation of our Trades with the financial forces of other
      countries, regardless of the rubbish talked by 'patriots' on the loss of
      our position and prestige. But he is not fond of money,&mdash;he is not
      fond of money! Would that he were!&mdash;for so <i>I</i> should be
      virtually king of the King!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Cogitating various problems on his return to his own house that evening,
      he remembered that despite numerous protests and petitions, the King had,
      up to the present, paid no attention to the appeals of his people against
      the increasing inroads of taxation. The only two measures he had carried
      with a high and imperative hand, were first,&mdash;the 'vetoing' of an
      intended declaration of war,&mdash;and the refusal of extensive lands to
      the Jesuits. The first was the more important action, as, while it had won
      the gratitude and friendship of a previously hostile State, it had lost
      several 'noble' gamblers in the griefs of nations, some millions of money.
      The check to the Jesuits was comparatively trivial, yet it had already
      produced far-reaching effects, and had offended the powers at the Vatican.
      But, beyond this, things remained apparently as they were; true, the
      Socialists were growing stronger;&mdash;but there was no evidence that the
      Government was growing weaker.
    </p>
    <p>
      "After all," thought Pérousse, as a result of his meditations; "there is
      no immediate cause for anxiety. If Lutera has sent in his resignation, it
      may not be accepted. That rests&mdash;like other things&mdash;with the
      King." And a vague surprise affected him at this fact. "Curious!" he
      muttered,&mdash;"Very curious that he, who was a Nothing, should now be a
      Something! The change has taken place very rapidly,&mdash;and very
      strangely! I wonder what&mdash;or who&mdash;is moving him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      But to this inward query he received no satisfactory reply. The mysterious
      upshot of the whole position was the same,&mdash;namely, that somehow, in
      the most unaccountable, inexplicable manner, the wind and weather of
      affairs had so veered round, that the security of Ministers and the
      stability of Government rested, not with themselves or the nature of their
      quarrels and discussions, but solely on one whom they were accustomed to
      consider as a mere ornamental figure-head,&mdash;the King.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some few days after the unexpected turbulent rising of the mob, it was
      judged advisable to give the people something in the way of a 'gala,' or
      spectacle, in order to distract their attention from their own grievances,
      and to draw them away from their Socialistic clubs and conventions, to the
      contemplation of a parade of Royal state and splendour. The careful
      student of History cannot fail to note that whenever the rottenness and
      inadequacy of a Government are most apparent, great 'shows' and Royal
      ceremonials are always resorted to, in order to divert the minds of the
      people from the bitter consideration of a deficient Exchequer and a
      diminishing National Honour. The authorities who organize these State
      masquerades are wise in their generation. They know that the
      working-classes very seldom have the leisure to think for themselves, and
      that they often lack the intelligent ability to foresee the difficulties
      and dangers menacing their country's welfare;&mdash;but that they are
      always ready, with the strangest fatuity, patience, and good-nature, to
      take their wives and families to see any new variation of a world's 'Punch
      and Judy' play, particularly if there is a savour of Royalty about it,
      accompanied by a brass band, well-equipped soldiers, and gilded coaches.
      Though they take no part in the pageant, beyond consenting to be hustled
      and rudely driven back by the police like intrusive sheep, out of the
      sacred way of a Royal progress, they nevertheless have an instinctive (and
      very correct) idea that somehow or other it is all part of the 'fun' for
      which they have paid their money. There is no more actual reverence or
      respect for the positive Person of Royalty in such a parade, than there is
      for the Wonderful Performing Pig who takes part in a circus-procession
      through a country town. The public impression is simple,&mdash;That having
      to pay for the up-keep of a Throne, its splendours should be occasionally
      'trotted out' to see whether they are worth the nation's annual
      expenditure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Moved entirely by this plain and practical sentiment, the popular breast
      was thrilled with some amount of interest and animation when it was
      announced that his Majesty the King would, on a certain afternoon, go in
      state to lay the foundation-stone of the Grand National Theatre, which was
      the very latest pet project of various cogitating Jews and cautious
      millionaires. The Grand National Theatre was intended to 'supply,'
      according to a stock newspaper phrase, 'a long-felt want.' It was to be a
      'philanthropic' scheme, by which the 'Philanthropists' would receive
      excellent interest for their money. Ostensibly, it was to provide the
      'masses' with the highest form of dramatic entertainment at the lowest
      cost;&mdash;but there were many intricate wheels within wheels in the
      elaborate piece of stock-jobbing mechanism, by which the public would be
      caught and fooled&mdash;as usual&mdash;and the speculators therein
      rendered triumphant. Sufficient funds were at hand to start the building
      of the necessary edifice, and the King's 'gracious' consent to lay the
      first stone, with full state and ceremony, was hailed by the promoters of
      the plan as of the happiest augury. For with such approval and support
      openly given, all the Snob-world would follow the Royal 'lead'&mdash;quite
      as infallibly as it did in the case of another monarch who, persuaded to
      drink of a certain mineral spring, and likewise to 'take shares' in its
      bottled waters, turned the said spring into a 'paying concern' at once,
      thereby causing much rejoicing among the Semites. The 'mob' might
      certainly decline to imitate the Snob-world,&mdash;but, considering the
      recent riotous outbreak, it might be as well that the overbold and
      unwashen populace should be awed by the panoply and glory of earthly
      Majesty passing by in earthly splendour.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alas, poor Snob-world! How often has it thought the same thing! How often
      has it fancied that with show and glitter and brazen ostentation of mere
      purse-power, it can quell the rage for Justice, which, like a spark of
      God's own eternal Being, burns for ever in the soul of a People! Ah, that
      rage for Justice!&mdash;that divine fury and fever which with strong
      sweating and delirium shakes the body politic and cleanses it from
      accumulated sickly humours and pestilence! What would the nations be
      without its periodical and merciful visitations! Tearing down old
      hypocrisies,&mdash;rooting up weedy abuses,&mdash;rending asunder rotten
      conventions,&mdash;what wonder if thrones and sceptres, and even the heads
      of kings get sometimes mixed into the general swift clearance of
      long-accumulated dirt and disorder! And vainly at such times does the
      Snob-world anxiously proffer golden pieces for the price of its life!
      There shall not then be millions enough in all the earth, to purchase the
      safety of one proved Liar who has wilfully robbed his neighbour!
    </p>
    <p>
      No hint of the underworkings of the people's thought, or the movement of
      the times was, however, apparent in the aspect of the gay multitudes that
      poured along the principal thoroughfares of the metropolis on the day
      appointed for the ceremony in which the King had consented to take the
      leading part. Poor and rich together, vied with one another to secure the
      various best points of view from whence the Royal pageant could be seen,
      winding down in glittering length from the Palace and Citadel, past the
      Cathedral, and so on to the great open square, where, surrounded by
      fluttering flags and streamers, a huge block of stone hung suspended by
      ropes from a crane, ready to be lowered at the Royal touch, and fixed in
      its place by the Royal trowel, as the visible and solid beginning of the
      stately fabric, which, according to pictorial models was to rise from
      this, its first foundation, into a temple of art and architecture, devoted
      to Melpomene and Thalia.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a glorious day,&mdash;the sun shone with vigorous heat and lustre
      from a cloudless sky,&mdash;the sea was calm as an inland pool&mdash;and
      people wore their lightest, brightest and most festive attire. Fair
      "society" dames, clad in the last capricious mode of ever-changing
      Fashion, and shading their delicate, and not always natural, complexions
      with airy parasols, filmy and finely-coloured as the petals of flowers,
      queened it over the flocking crowds of pedestrians, as they were driven
      past in their softly-cushioned carriages drawn by high-stepping horses;&mdash;all
      the boudoirs and drawing-rooms of the most exclusive houses seemed to have
      emptied their luxury-loving occupants into the streets,&mdash;and the
      whole town was, for a few hours at any rate, apparently given over to
      holiday. As the long line of soldiery preceding the King's carriage, wound
      down from the Citadel, groups of people cheered, and waved hats and
      handkerchiefs,&mdash;then, when his Majesty's own escort came into view,
      the cheering was redoubled,&mdash;and at last when the cumbrous,
      over-gilded, over-painted "Cinderella" State-coach appeared, and the
      familiar, but somewhat sternly-composed features of the King himself were
      perceived through the glass windows, a roar of acclamation, like the
      thundering of a long wave on an extensive stretch of rock-bound coast,
      echoed far and near, and again and again was repeated with increased and
      ever-increasing clamour. Who,&mdash;hearing such an enthusiastic greeting&mdash;would
      or could have imagined for one moment that the King, who was the object
      and centre of these tremendous plaudits, was at the same time judged as an
      enemy and an obstruction to justice by more than one half of the
      population! Yet it was so,&mdash;and so has often been. The populace will
      shout itself hoarse for any cause; whether it be a king going to be
      crowned, or a king going to be executed, the stimulus is the same, and the
      enthusiasm as passionate. It is merely the contagious hysteria of a moment
      that tickles their lungs to expansion in noise;&mdash;but the real
      sentiment of admiration for a fine character which might perhaps have
      moved the subjects of Richard Coeur de Lion to cries of exultation, is
      generally non-existent. And why? For no cause truly!&mdash;save that
      Lion-Hearts in kings no more pulsate through nations.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the time the Royal procession reached its destination the crowd had
      largely increased, and the press of people round the scene of the
      forthcoming function was great enough to be seriously embarrassing to both
      the soldiery and the police. Slowly the gorgeous State-coach lumbered up
      to the entrance of the ground railed off for the ceremony,&mdash;and
      between a line of armed guards, the King alighted. Vociferous cheering
      again broke out on all sides, which his Majesty acknowledged in the usual
      formal manner by a monotonous military salute performed at regular
      intervals. Received with obsequious deference by all the persons concerned
      in the Grand National Theatre project, he conversed with one or two, shook
      hands with others, and was just on the point of addressing a few of his
      usual suave compliments to some pretty women who had been invited to adorn
      the scene, when David Jost advanced smilingly, evidently sure of a
      friendly recognition. For had not the King, when Crown Prince and
      Heir-Apparent, hunted game in his preserves?&mdash;yea, had he not even
      dined with him?&mdash;and had not he, Jost, written whole columns of vapid
      twaddle about the 'Royal smile' and the 'Royal favour' till the outside
      public had sickened at every stroke of his flunkey pen? How came it, then,
      that his Majesty seemed on this occasion to have no recollection of him,
      and looked over and beyond him in the airiest way, as though he were a
      far-off Jew in Jerusalem, instead of being the assumptive-Orthodox
      proprietor of several European newspapers published for the general
      misinformation and plunder of gullible Christians? Dismayed at the Royal
      coldness of eye, Jost stepped back with an uncomfortably crimson face; and
      one of the ladies present, personally knowing him, and seeing his
      discomfiture, ventured to call the King's attention to his presence and to
      make way for his approach, by murmuring gently, "Mr. Jost, Sir!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, indeed!" said the monarch, with calm grey eyes still fixed on
      vacancy,&mdash;"I do not know anyone of that name! Permit me to admire
      that exquisite arrangement of flowers!" and, smiling affably on the
      astonished and embarrassed lady, he led her aside, altogether away from
      Jost's vicinity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stricken to the very dust of abasement by this direct "cut" so publicly
      administered, the crestfallen editor and proprietor of many journals stood
      aghast for a moment,&mdash;then as various unbidden thoughts began to
      chase one another through his bewildered head, he was seized with a
      violent trembling. He remembered every foolish, imprudent and disloyal
      remark he had made to the stranger named Pasquin Leroy who had called upon
      him bearing the Premier's signet,&mdash;and reflecting that this very
      Pasquin Leroy was now, by some odd chance, a contributor of political
      leaders and other articles to the rival daily newspaper which had
      published the King's official refusal of a grant of land to the Jesuits,
      he writhed inwardly with impotent fury. For might not this unknown man,
      Leroy,&mdash;if he were,&mdash;as he possibly was,&mdash;a friend of the
      King's&mdash;go to the full length of declaring all he knew and all he had
      learned from Jost's own lips, concerning certain 'financial secrets,'
      which if fully disclosed, would utterly dismember the Government and put
      the nation itself in peril? Might he not already even have informed the
      King? With his little, swine-like eyes retreating under the crinkling fat
      of his lowering brows, Jost, hot and cold by turns, wandered confusedly
      out of the 'exclusive' set of persons connected with the 'Grand National
      Theatre' scheme, who were now gathered round the suspended
      foundation-stone to which the King was approaching. He pretended not to
      see the curious eyes that stared at him, or the sneering mouths that
      smiled at the open slight he had received. Pushing his way through the
      crowd, he jostled against the thin black-garmented figure of a priest,&mdash;no
      other than Monsignor Del Fortis, who, with an affable word of recognition,
      drew aside to allow him passage. Affecting his usual 'company-manner' of
      tolerant good-nature, he forced himself to speak to this 'holy' man, who,
      at any rate, had paid him good money in round sums for so-called
      'articles' or rather puff-advertisements in his paper concerning Church
      matters.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good-day, Monsignor!" he said&mdash;"You are not often seen at a Royal
      pageant! How comes it that you, of all persons in the world have brought
      yourself to witness the laying of the foundation-stone of a Theatre? Does
      not your calling forbid any patronage of the mimic Art?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The priest's thin lips parted, showing a glimmer of wolfish teeth behind
      the pale stretched line of flesh.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not by any means!" he replied suavely&mdash;"In the present levelling and
      amalgamation of social interests, the Church and Stage are drawing very
      closely together."
    </p>
    <p>
      "True!" said Jost, with a grin&mdash;"One might very well be taken for the
      other!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Del Fortis looked at him meditatively.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This," he said, waving his lean hand towards the centre of the brilliant
      crowd where now the King stood, "is a kind of drama in its way. And you,
      Mr. Jost, have just played one little scene in it!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Jost reddened, and bit his lip.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am also another actor on the boards," continued Del Fortis smiling
      darkly;&mdash;"if only as a spectator in the 'super' crowd. And other
      comedians and tragedians are doubtless present, of whom we may hear anon!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The King has nasty humours sometimes," said Jost shortly, looking down at
      the flower in his buttonhole, and absently flicking off one of its petals
      with his fat forefinger&mdash;"He ought to be made to pay for them!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ha, ha! Very good! Certainly!" and Del Fortis gave a piously-deprecating
      nod&mdash;"He ought to be made to pay! Especially when he hurts the
      feelings of his old friends! Are you going, Mr. Jost? Yes? What a pity!
      But you no doubt have your reporters present?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, there are plenty of them about,"&mdash;said Jost carelessly, "But I
      shall condense all the account of these proceedings into a few lines."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ha,&mdash;ha!" laughed Del Fortis,&mdash;"I understand! Revenge&mdash;revenge!
      But&mdash;in certain cases&mdash;the briefest description is sometimes the
      most graphic&mdash;and startling! Good-day!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Jost returned the salute curtly, and went,&mdash;not to leave the scene
      altogether, but merely to take up a position of vantage immediately above
      and behind the surging crowd, where from a distance he could watch all
      that was going on. He saw the King lift his hand towards the ropes and
      pulleys of the crane above him,&mdash;and as it was touched by the Royal
      finger, the foundation stone was slowly lowered into the deep socket
      prepared for it, where gold and silver coins of the year's currency had
      already been strewn. Then, with the aid of a silver trowel set in a handle
      of gold, and obsequiously presented by the managing director of the
      scheme, his Majesty dabbed in a little mortar, and declared in a loud
      voice that the stone was 'well and truly laid.' A burst of cheering
      greeted the announcement, and the band struck up the country's National
      Hymn, this being the usual sign that the ceremony was at an end. Whereupon
      the King, shaking hands again cordially with the various parties
      concerned, and again shedding the lustre of his smile upon the various
      ladies with whom he had been conversing, made his way very leisurely to
      his State equipage, which, with its six magnificently caparisoned horses,
      stood prepared for his departure, the door being already held open for him
      by one of the attendant powdered and gold-laced flunkeys. Sir Roger de
      Launay walked immediately behind his Sovereign, and Professor von Glauben
      was close at hand, companioned by two of the gentlemen of the Royal
      Household. All at once a young man pushed himself out of the crowd nearest
      to the enclosure,&mdash;paused a moment irresolute, and then, with a
      single determined bound reached the King's side.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thief of the People's money! Take that!" he shouted, wildly,&mdash;and,
      brandishing aloft a glittering stiletto, he aimed it straight at the
      monarch's heart!
    </p>
    <p>
      But the blow never reached its destination, for a woman, closely veiled in
      black, suddenly threw herself swiftly and adroitly between the King's body
      and the descending blade, shielding his breast with both her outstretched
      arms. The dagger struck her violently, piercing her flesh through the
      upper part of her right shoulder, and under the sheer force of the blow,
      she fell senseless.
    </p>
    <p>
      The whole incident took place in less time than it could be breathlessly
      told,&mdash;and even as she who had risked her life to save the King's,
      sank bleeding to the ground, the police seized the assassin red-handed in
      his mad and criminal act, and wrenched the murderous weapon from his hand.
      He was a mere lad of eighteen or twenty, and seemed dazed, submitting to
      be bound and handcuffed without a word. The King, perfectly tranquil and
      unhurt, bared his head to the wild cries and hysterical cheering of the
      excited spectators to whom his narrow escape from death appeared a kind of
      miracle, moving them to frantic paroxysms of passionate enthusiasm, and
      then bent anxiously down over the prostrate form of his rescuer,
      endeavouring himself to raise her from the ground. A hundred hands at once
      proffered assistance;&mdash;Sir Roger de Launay, pale to the lips with the
      shock of sick horror he had experienced at what might so easily have been
      a national catastrophe, assisted the police in forming a strong cordon
      round the person of his beloved Royal master, in order to guard him
      against any further possible attack,&mdash;and Professor von Glauben,
      obeying the King's signal, knelt down by the unconscious woman's side to
      examine the extent of her injury. Gently he turned back the close folds of
      her enveloping veil,&mdash;then gave a little start and cry:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Gott in Himmel!" And he hastily drew down the veil again as the King
      approached with the question&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is she dangerously hurt?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, Sir!&mdash;I think not&mdash;I hope not&mdash;but&mdash;!"
    </p>
    <p>
      And the Professor's eyes looked volumes of suggestion. Catching his
      expression, the King drew still nearer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Uncover her face,&mdash;give her air!" he commanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a perplexed side-glance at Sir Roger de Launay, the Professor obeyed,&mdash;and
      the sunshine fell full on the white calm features and closed eyelids of
      "the woman known as Lotys." Her black dress was darkly stained and soaked
      with oozing blood&mdash;and the deep dull gold of her hair was touched
      here and there with the same crimson hue;&mdash;but there was a smile on
      her lips, and her face was as fair and placid as though it had been
      smoothed out of all pain and trouble by the restful touch of Death.
      Silently, and with a perfectly inscrutable demeanour, the King surveyed
      her for a moment. Then, raising his plumed hat with grave grace and
      courtesy, he looked on all those who stood about him, soldiery, police and
      spectators.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Does anyone here present know this lady?" he demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      A crowd of eager heads were pushed forward, and then a low murmur began,
      which deepened into a steady roar of delighted acclamation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lotys! Lotys!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The name was caught up quickly and repeated from mouth to mouth&mdash;till
      away on the extreme outskirts of the crowd it was tossed back again with
      shouts&mdash;"Lotys! Lotys!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Swiftly the news ran like an electric current through the whole body of
      the populace, that it was Lotys, their own Lotys, their friend, their
      fellow-worker, the idol of the poorer classes, that had saved the life of
      the King! Half-incredulous, half-admiring, the mob listened to the growing
      rumour, and the general excitement increased in intensity among them.
      David Jost, from his point of observation, caught the infection, and
      realizing at once the value of the dramatic "copy" for his paper, to be
      obtained out of such a situation, jumped into the nearest vehicle and was
      driven straight to his offices, there to send electric messages of the
      news to every quarter of the world, and to endeavour by printed loyal
      outbursts of "gush" to turn the current of the King's displeasure against
      him into a more favourable direction. Meanwhile the King himself gave
      orders that his wounded rescuer should be conveyed in one of the Royal
      carriages straight to the Palace, and there attended by his own physician.
      Professor von Glauben was entrusted with the carrying-out of this command,&mdash;and
      the monarch, then entering his own State-equipage, started on his homeward
      progress.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thundering cheers now greeted him at every step;&mdash;for an hour at
      least the populace went mad with rapture, shouting, singing and calling
      alternately for "The King!" and "Lotys!" with no respect of persons, or
      consideration as to their differing motives and opposite stations in life.
      Two facts only were clear to them,&mdash;first an attempt had been made to
      assassinate the King,&mdash;secondly, that Lotys had frustrated the
      attempt, and risked her own life to save that of the monarch. These were
      enough to set fire to the passionate sentiments of a warm-blooded,
      restless Southern people, and they gave full sway to their feelings
      accordingly. So, amid deafening plaudits, the Royal procession wended its
      way back to the Citadel, the State-coach moving at a snail's pace in order
      to allow the people to see the King for themselves, and make sure he was
      uninjured, as they cheered, and followed it in surging throngs to the very
      gates of the Palace,&mdash;while in another and reverse direction the
      wretched youth whose miserable effort to commit a dastard crime had so
      fortunately failed, was marched off, under the guard of a strong body of
      police to the State-Prison, there to await his trial and condemnation. A
      small crowd, hooting and cursing the criminal, pursued him as he went, and
      one personage, austere and dignified, also followed, at a distance, as
      though curious to see the last of the would-be murderer ere he was shut
      out from liberty,&mdash;and this was Monsignor Del Fortis.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXIV. &mdash; A WOMAN'S REASON
    </h2>
    <p>
      When Lotys recovered from her death-like swoon, she found herself on a
      sofa among heaped-up soft cushions, in a small semi-darkened room hung
      with draperies of rose satin, which were here and there drawn aside to
      show exquisite groupings of Saxe china and rare miniatures on ivory;&mdash;the
      ceiling above her was a painted mirror, where Venus in her car of flowers,
      drawn by doves, was pictured floating across a crystal sea,&mdash;the
      floor was strewn with white bearskins,&mdash;the corners were filled with
      palms and flowers. As she regarded these unaccustomed surroundings
      wonderingly, a firm hand was laid on her wrist, and a brusque voice said
      in her ear:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lie still, if you please! You have been seriously hurt! You must rest."
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned feebly towards the speaker, and saw a big burly man with a bald
      head, seated at her side, who held a watch in one hand, and felt her pulse
      with the other. She could not discern his features plainly, for his back
      was set to the already shaded light, and her own eyes were weak and dim.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are very kind!" she murmured&mdash;"I do not quite remember&mdash;Ah,
      yes!" and a quick flash of animation passed over her face&mdash;"I know
      now! The King! Is&mdash;is all well?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "All is well, thanks to you!" replied the gruff voice&mdash;"You have
      saved his life."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank God!"&mdash;and she closed her eyes again wearily, while two slow
      tears trickled from under the shut white lids&mdash;"Thank God!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Professor von Glauben, placed in charge of her by the King's command,
      gently relinquished the small white hand he held, and stepping noiselessly
      to a table near at hand, poured out from one of the various little flasks
      set thereon, a cordial the properties of which were alone known to
      himself, and held the glass to her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Drink this off at once!"&mdash;he said authoritatively, yet kindly.
    </p>
    <p>
      She obeyed. He then, turning aside with the empty glass, sat down and
      watched her from a little distance. Soon a faint flush tinged her
      dead-white skin, and presently, with a deep sigh, she opened her eyes
      again. Then she became aware of a stiffness and smart in her right
      shoulder, and saw that it was tightly bandaged, and that the bodice of her
      dress was cut away from it. Lying perfectly still, she gradually brought
      her strong spirit of self-control to bear on the situation, and tried to
      collect her scattered thoughts. Very few minutes sufficed her to recollect
      all that had happened, and as she realised more and more vividly that she
      was in some strange and luxurious abode where she had no business or
      desire to be, she gathered all the forces of her mind to her aid, and with
      but a slight effort, sat upright. Professor von Glauben came towards her
      with an exclamation of warning&mdash;but she motioned him back with a very
      decided gesture.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Please do not trouble!" she said&mdash;"I am quite able to move&mdash;to
      stand&mdash;see!" And she rose to her feet, trembling a little, and
      steadying herself by resting one hand on the edge of the sofa. "I do not
      know who you are, but I am sure you have been most kind to me! And if you
      would do me a still greater kindness, you will let me go away from here at
      once!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Impossible, Madame!" declared the Professor, firmly&mdash;"His Majesty,
      the King&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What of his Majesty, the King?" demanded Lotys with sudden hauteur&mdash;"Am
      I not mistress of my own actions?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The Professor made an elaborate bow.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Most unquestionably you are, Madame!" he replied&mdash;"But you are also
      for the moment, a guest in the King's Palace; and having saved his life,
      you will surely not withhold from him the courteous acceptance of his
      hospitality?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The King's Palace!" she echoed, and a little disdainful smile crossed her
      lips&mdash;"I,&mdash;Lotys,&mdash;in the King's Palace!" She moved a few
      steps, and drew herself proudly erect. "You, sir, are a servant of the
      King's?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am his Majesty's resident physician, at your service!" he said, with
      another bow&mdash;"I have had the honour of attending to the wound you so
      heroically received in his defence,&mdash;and though it is not a dangerous
      wound, it is an exceedingly unpleasant one I assure you,&mdash;and will
      give you a good deal of pain and trouble. Let me advise you very earnestly
      to stay where you are, and rest&mdash;do not think of leaving the Palace
      to-night."
    </p>
    <p>
      She sighed restlessly. "I must not think of staying in it!" she replied.
      "But I do not wish to seem churlish&mdash;or ungrateful for your care and
      kindness;&mdash;will you tell the King&mdash;" Here she broke off
      abruptly, and fixed her eyes searchingly on his face. "Strange!" she
      murmured&mdash;"I seem to have seen you before,&mdash;or someone very like
      you!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The Professor was troubled with a sudden fit of coughing which made him
      very red in the face, and obliged him to turn away for a moment in order
      to recover himself. Still struggling with that obstinate catch in his
      throat he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "You were saying, Madame, that you wished me to tell the King something?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes!" said Lotys eagerly&mdash;"if you will be so good! Tell him that I
      thank him for his courtesy;&mdash;but that I must go away from this
      Palace,&mdash;that I cannot&mdash;may not&mdash;stop in it an hour longer!
      He does not know who it is that saved his life,&mdash;if he did, he would
      not wish me to remain a moment under his roof! He would be as anxious and
      willing for me to leave as I am to go! Will you tell him this?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Madame, I will tell him," replied the Professor deferentially, yet with a
      slight smile&mdash;"But&mdash;if it will satisfy your scruples, or ease
      your mind at all,&mdash;I may as well inform you that his Majesty does
      know who you are! The populace itself declared your name to him, with
      shouts of acclamation." She flushed a vivid red, then grew very pale.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If that be so, then he must also be aware that I am his sworn enemy!" she
      said,&mdash;"And, that in accordance with the principles I hold, I cannot
      possibly remain under his roof! Therefore I trust, sir, you will have the
      kindness to provide me with a way of quick exit before my presence here
      becomes too publicly reported."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Professor was slightly nonplussed. He considered for a moment; then
      rapidly made up his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Madame, I will do so!" he said&mdash;"That is, if you will permit me
      first of all to announce your intention of leaving the Palace, to the
      King. Pardon me for suggesting that his Majesty can hardly regard as an
      enemy a lady who has saved his life at the risk of her own."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I did not save it because he is the King," she said curtly, "And you are
      at liberty to tell him so. Please make haste to inform him at once of my
      desire to leave the Palace,&mdash;and say also, that if he considers he
      owes me any gratitude, he will show it by not detaining me."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Professor bowed and retired. Lotys, left alone, sat down for a moment
      in one of the luxuriously cushioned chairs, and pressed her left hand hard
      over her eyes to try and still their throbbing ache. Her right arm was
      bound up and useless,&mdash;and the pain from the wound in her shoulder
      caused her acute agony,&mdash;but she had a will of iron, and she had
      trained her mental forces to control, if not entirely to master, her
      physical weaknesses. She thought, not of her own suffering, but of the
      exciting incident in which mere impulse had led her to take so marked a
      share. It was by pure accident that she had joined the crowd assembled to
      see the King lay the foundation-stone of the proposed new Theatre. She had
      been as it were, entangled in the press of the people, and had got pushed
      towards the centre of the scene almost against her own volition. And while
      she had stood,&mdash;a passive and unwilling spectator of the pageant,&mdash;her
      attention had been singularly attracted towards the uneasy and restless
      movements of the youth who had afterwards attempted the assassination of
      the monarch. She had watched him narrowly; though she could not have
      explained why she did so, even to herself. He was a complete stranger to
      her, and yet, with her quick intuition, she had discerned a curious
      expression of anxiety and fear in his face, as though of the impending
      horror of a crime,&mdash;a look which, because it was so strained and
      unnatural, had aroused her suspicion. When she had sprung forward to
      shield the King, only one idea had inspired her,&mdash;and that idea she
      would not now fully own even to herself, because it was so entirely,
      weakly feminine. Nevertheless, from woman's weakness has often sprung a
      hero's strength&mdash;and so it had proved in this case. She did not,
      however, allow herself to dwell on the instinctive impulse which had
      thrown her on the King's breast, ready to receive her own death-blow
      rather than that he should die; she preferred to elude that question, and
      to consider her action solely from the standpoint of those Socialistic
      theories with which she was indissolubly associated.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Had I not frustrated the attempt, the crime would have been set down to
      us and our Brotherhood," she said to herself, "Sergius&mdash;or Paul
      Zouche&mdash;or I myself&mdash;or even Pasquin&mdash;yes, even he!&mdash;might,
      and doubtless would, have been accused of instigating it. As it is, I
      think I have saved the situation." She rose and walked slowly up and down
      the room. "I wonder who is behind the wretched boy concerned in this
      business? He is too young to have determined on such a deed himself,&mdash;unless
      he is mad;&mdash;he must be a tool in the hands of others."
    </p>
    <p>
      Here spying her long black cloak hanging across a chair, she took it up
      and threw it round her,&mdash;her face was reflected back upon her from a
      mirror set in the wall, round which a cluster of ivory cupids clambered,&mdash;and
      she looked critically at her white drawn features, and the disordered
      masses of her hair. Loosening these abundant locks, she shook them down
      and gathered them into her one uncrippled hand, preparatory to twisting
      them into the usual knot at the back of her head, the while she looked at
      the little sculptured <i>amorini</i> set round the mirror, with a
      compassionate smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Such a number of mimic Loves where there is no real love!" she said half
      aloud,&mdash;when the opening of a door, and the swaying movement of a
      curtain pushed aside, startled her; and still holding her rich hair up in
      her hand she turned quickly,&mdash;to find herself face to face with,&mdash;the
      King.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was an instant's dead silence. Dropping the silken gold weight of
      her tresses to fall as they would, regardless of conventional appearances,
      she stood erect, making all unconsciously to herself, a picture of
      statuesque and beauteous tragedy. Her plain black garments,&mdash;the long
      cloak enveloping her slight form, and the glorious tangle of her unbound
      hair rippling loosely about her pale face, in which her eyes shone like
      blue flowers, made luminous by the sunlight of the inspired soul behind
      them, all gave her an almost supernatural air,&mdash;and made her seem as
      wholly unlike any other woman as a strange leaf from an unexplored country
      is unlike the foliage common to one's native land. The King looked
      steadfastly upon her; she, meeting his gaze with equal steadfastness, felt
      her heart beating violently, though, as she well knew, it was not with
      fear. She had no thought of Court etiquette,&mdash;nor had she any reason
      to consider it, his Majesty having himself deliberately trespassed upon
      its rules by visiting her thus alone and unattended. She offered no
      reverence,&mdash;no salutation;&mdash;she simply stood before him, quite
      silent, awaiting his pleasure,&mdash;though in her eyes there shone a
      dangerous brilliancy that was almost feverish, and nervous tremors shook
      her from head to foot. The strange dumb spell between them relaxed at
      last. With a kind of effort which expressed itself in the extra rigidity
      and pallor of his fine features, the King spoke:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Madame, I have come to thank you! Your noble act of heroism this
      afternoon has saved my life. I do not say it is worth saving!&mdash;but
      the Nation appears to think it is,&mdash;and in the name of the Nation,
      whose servant I am, I offer you my personal gratitude&mdash;and service!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He bowed low as he said these words gravely and courteously. Her eyes
      still searched his face wistfully, with the eager plaintive expression of
      a child looking for some precious treasure it has lost. She strove to calm
      her throbbing pulses,&mdash;to quiet the hurrying blood in her veins,&mdash;to
      brace herself up to her usual impervious height of composure and
      self-control.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I need no thanks!" she answered briefly&mdash;"I have only done my duty!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nay, Madame, is it quite consistent with your duty to shield from death
      one so hated by your disciples and followers?" he asked, with a tinge of
      melancholy in his accents&mdash;"You&mdash;as the famous Lotys&mdash;should
      have helped to kill, not to save!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She regarded him fearlessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You mistake!" she said&mdash;"As King, you should learn to know your
      subjects better! We are not murderers. We do not seek your life,&mdash;we
      seek to make you understand the need there is of honesty and justice. We
      live our lives among the poor; and we see those poor crushed down into the
      dust by the rich, without hope and without help,&mdash;and we endeavour to
      rouse them to a sense of this Wrong, so that they may, by persistence,
      obtain Right. We do not want the death of any man! Even to a traitor we
      give warning and time, ere we punish his treachery. The unhappy wretch who
      attempted your life to-day was not of our party, or our teaching, thank
      God!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am sure of that!" he said very gently, his face brightening with a kind
      smile,&mdash;then, seeing her swerve, as though about to fall, he caught
      her on one arm&mdash;"You are faint! You must not stand too long. I fear
      you are suffering from the pain of that cruel wound inflicted on you for
      my sake!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A little&mdash;" she managed to say, with white lips&mdash;"But it is
      nothing&mdash;it will soon pass&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      She sank helplessly into the chair he placed for her, and mutely watched
      him as he walked to the window and threw it open, admitting the sweet,
      fresh, sea-scented air, and a flood of crimson radiance from the setting
      sun.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am informed that you wish to quit the Palace at once," he said,
      averting his gaze from hers for a moment;&mdash;"Need I say how much I
      regret this decision of yours? Both I and the Queen had hoped you would
      have remained with us, under the care of our own physician, till you were
      quite recovered. But I owe you too great a debt already to make any
      further claim upon you&mdash;and I will not command you to stay, if you
      desire to go."
    </p>
    <p>
      She lifted her head;&mdash;the faint colour was returning to her cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thank you!" she said simply;&mdash;"I do indeed desire to go. Every
      moment spent here is a moment wasted!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You think so?"&mdash;and, turning from the window where he stood, he
      confronted her again;&mdash;"May I venture to suggest that you hardly do
      justice to me, or to the situation? You have placed me under very great
      obligations&mdash;surely you should endure my company long enough to tell
      me at least how I can in some measure show my personal recognition of your
      brave and self-sacrificing action!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him in musing silence. A strange glow came into her eyes,&mdash;a
      deeper crimson flushed her cheek.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You can do nothing for me!" she said, after a long pause, "You are a King&mdash;I,
      a poor commoner. I would not be indebted to you for all the world! I am
      prouder of my 'common' estate than you are of your royalty! What are
      'royal' rewards? Jewels, money, place, title! All valueless to me! If you
      would serve anyone, serve the People;&mdash;do something to deserve their
      trust! If you would show <i>me</i> any personal recognition, as you say,
      for saving your life, make that life more noble!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He heard her without offence, holding himself mute and motionless. She
      rose from her seat, and approached him more closely.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps, after all, it is well that I was,&mdash;unconsciously and
      against my own volition,&mdash;brought here," she said; "Perhaps it is
      God's will that I should speak with you! For, as a rule none of your
      unknown subjects can, or may speak with you!&mdash;you are so much hemmed
      in and ringed round with slaves and parasites! In so far as this goes, you
      are to be pitied; though it rests with you to shake yourself free from the
      toils of vulgar adulation. Your flatterers tell you nothing. They are
      careful to keep you shut out of your own kingdom&mdash;to hide from you
      things that are true,&mdash;things that you ought to know; they fool you
      with false assurances of national tranquillity and content,&mdash;they
      persuade you to play, like an over-grown child, with the toys of luxury,&mdash;they
      lead you, a mere puppet, round and round in the clockwork routine of a
      foolish and licentious society,&mdash;when you might be a Man!&mdash;up
      and doing man's work that should help you to regenerate and revivify the
      whole country! I speak boldly&mdash;yes!&mdash;because I do not fear you!&mdash;because
      I have no favours to gain from you,&mdash;because to me,&mdash;Lotys,&mdash;you,&mdash;the
      King&mdash;are nothing!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Her voice, perfectly tranquil, even, and coldly sweet, had not a single
      vibration of uncertainty or hesitation in it&mdash;and her words seemed to
      cut through the stillness of the room with clean incisiveness like the
      sweep of a sword-blade. Outside, the sea murmured and the leaves rustled,&mdash;the
      sun had sunk, leaving behind it a bright, pearly twilight sky, flecked
      with pink clouds like scattered rose-petals.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked straight at her,&mdash;his clear dark grey eyes were filled with
      the glowing fire of strongly suppressed feeling. Some hasty ejaculation
      sprang to his lips, but he checked it, and pacing once or twice up and
      down, suddenly wheeled round, and again confronted her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If, as a king, I fall so far short of kingliness, and am nothing to you,"&mdash;he
      said deliberately; "Why did you shield me from the assassin's dagger a
      while ago? Why not have let me perish?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She shook back her gold hair, and regarded him almost defiantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I did not save you because you are the King!" she replied&mdash;"Be
      assured of that!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He was vaguely astonished.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Merely a humane sentiment then?" he said&mdash;"Just as you would have
      saved a dog from drowning!"
    </p>
    <p>
      A little smile crept reluctantly round the corners of her mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There was another reason," she began in a low tone,&mdash;then paused&mdash;"But&mdash;only
      a woman's reason!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Something in her changing colour,&mdash;some delicate indefinable touch of
      tenderness and pathos, which softened her features and made them almost
      ethereal, sent a curious thrill through his blood.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A woman's reason!" he echoed; "May I not hear it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Again she hesitated,&mdash;then, as if despising herself for her own
      irresolution she spoke out bravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You may!"&mdash;she said&mdash;"There is nothing to conceal&mdash;nothing
      of which I am ashamed! Besides, it is the true motive of the action which
      you are pleased to call 'heroic.' I saved your life simply because&mdash;because
      you resemble in form and feature, in look and manner, the only man I
      love!"
    </p>
    <p>
      A curious silence followed her words. The faint far whispering of the
      leaves on the trees outside seemed almost intrusively loud in such a
      stillness,&mdash;the placid murmur of the sea against the cliff below the
      Palace became well-nigh suggestive of storm. Lotys was suddenly conscious
      of an odd strained sense of terror,&mdash;she had spoken as freely and
      frankly as she would have spoken to any one of her own associates,&mdash;and
      yet she felt that somehow she had been over-impulsive, and that in a
      thoughtless moment she had let slip some secret which placed her, weak and
      helpless, in the King's power. The King himself stood immovable as a
      figure of bronze,&mdash;his eyes resting upon her with a deep insistence
      of purpose, as though he sought to wrest some further confession from her
      soul. The tension between them was painful,&mdash;almost intolerable,&mdash;and
      though it lasted but a minute, that minute seemed weighted with the
      potentialities of years. Forcing herself to break the dumb spell, Lotys
      went on hurriedly and half desperately:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "You may smile at this," she said&mdash;"Men always jest with a woman's
      heart,&mdash;a woman's folly! But folly or no, I will not have you draw
      any false conclusions concerning me,&mdash;or flatter yourself that it was
      loyalty to you, or honour for your position that made me your living
      shield to-day. No!&mdash;for if you were not the exact counterpart of him
      who is dearer to me than all the world beside, I think I should have let
      you die! I think so&mdash;I do not know! Because, after all, you are not
      like him in mind or heart; it is only your outward bearing, your physical
      features that resemble his! But, even so, I could not have looked idly on,
      and seen his merest Resemblance slain! Now you understand! It is not for
      you, as King, that I have turned aside a murderer's weapon,&mdash;but
      solely because you have the face, the eyes, the smile of one who is a
      thousand times greater and nobler than you,&mdash;who, though poor and
      uncrowned, is a true king in the grace and thought and goodness of his
      actions,&mdash;who, all unlike you, personally attends to the wants of the
      poor, instead of neglecting them,&mdash;and who recognises, and does his
      best to remedy, the many wrongs which afflict the people of this land!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Her sweet voice thrilled with passion,&mdash;her cheeks glowed,&mdash;unconsciously
      she stretched out her uninjured hand with an eloquent gesture of pride and
      conviction. The King's figure, till now rigid and motionless, stirred;&mdash;advancing
      a step, he took that hand before she could withhold it, and raised it to
      his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Madame, I am twice honoured!" he said, in accents that shook ever so
      slightly&mdash;"To resemble a good man even outwardly is something,&mdash;to
      wear in any degree the lineaments of one whom a brave and true woman
      honours by her love is still more! You have made me very much your debtor"&mdash;here
      he gently relinquished the hand he had kissed&mdash;"but believe me, I
      shall endeavour most faithfully to meet the claim you have upon my
      gratitude!" Here he paused, and drawing back, bowed courteously. "The way
      for your departure is clear," he continued;&mdash;"I have ordered a
      carriage to be in waiting at one of the private entrances to the Palace.
      Professor von Glauben, my physician, who has just attended you, will
      escort you to it. You will pass out quite unnoticed,&mdash;and be,&mdash;as
      you desire it&mdash;again at full liberty. Let the memory of the King
      whose life you saved trouble you no more,&mdash;except when you look upon
      his better counterpart!&mdash;as then, perchance, you may think more
      kindly of him! For he has to suffer!&mdash;not so much for his own faults,
      as for the faults of a system formulated by his ancestors."
    </p>
    <p>
      Her intense eyes glowed with a fire of enthusiasm as she lifted them to
      his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Kingship would be a grand system," she said, "if kings were true! And
      Autocracy would be the best and noblest form of government in the world,
      if autocrats could be found who were intellectual and honest at one and
      the same time!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at her observantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You think they are neither?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>I</i> think? 'I' am nothing,&mdash;my opinions count for nothing! But
      History gives evidence, and supplies proof of their incompetency. A great
      king,&mdash;good as well as great,&mdash;would be the salvation of this
      present time of the world!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Still he kept his eyes upon her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Go on!"&mdash;he said&mdash;"There is something in your mind which you
      would fain express to me more openly. You have eloquent features, Madame!&mdash;and
      your looks are the candid mirror of your thoughts. Speak, I beg of you!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The light of a daring inward hope flashed in her face and inspired her
      very attitude, as she stood before him, entirely regardless of herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then,&mdash;since you give me leave,&mdash;I <i>will</i> speak!" she
      said; "For perhaps I shall never see you again&mdash;never have the chance
      to ask you, as a Man whom the mere accident of birth has made a king, to
      have more thought, more pity, more love for your subjects! Surely you
      should be their guardian&mdash;their father&mdash;their protector? Surely
      you should not leave them to become the prey of unscrupulous financiers or
      intriguing Churchmen? Some say you are yourself involved in the cruel
      schemes which are slowly but steadily robbing this country's people of
      their Trades, the lawful means of their subsistence; and that you approve,
      in the main, of the private contracts which place our chief manufactures
      and lines of traffic in the hands of foreign rivals. But I do not believe
      this. We&mdash;and by we, I mean the Revolutionary party&mdash;try hard
      not to believe this! I admit to you, as faithfully as if I stood on my
      trial before you, that much of the work to which we, as a party have
      pledged ourselves, consists in moving the destruction of the Monarchy, and
      the formation of a Republic. But why? Only because the Monarchy has proved
      itself indifferent to the needs of the people, and deaf to their
      protestations against injustice! Thus we have conceived it likely that a
      Republic might help to mend matters,&mdash;if it were in power for at
      least some twenty or thirty years,&mdash;but at the same time we know well
      enough that if a King ruled over us who was indeed a King,&mdash;who would
      refuse to be the tool of party speculators, and who could not be moved
      this way or that by the tyrants of finance, the people would have far more
      chance of equality and right under a Republic even! Only we cannot find
      that king!&mdash;no country can! You, for instance, are no hero! You will
      not think for yourself, though you might; you only interest yourself in
      affairs that may redound to your personal and private credit; or in those
      which affect 'society,' the most dissolute portion of the community,&mdash;and
      you have shown so little individuality in yourself or your actions, that
      your unexpected refusal to grant Crown lands to the Jesuits was scarcely
      believed in or accepted, otherwise than as a caprice, till your own
      'official' announcement. Even now we can scarcely be brought to look upon
      it except as an impulse inspired by fear! Herein, we do you, no doubt, a
      grave injustice; I, for one, honestly believe that you have refused these
      lands to the Priest-Politicians, out of earnest consideration for the
      future peace and welfare of your subjects."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nay, why believe even thus much of me?" he interrupted with a grave
      smile; "May you not be misled by that Resemblance I bear, to one who is,
      in your eyes, so much my superior?"
    </p>
    <p>
      A faint expression of offence darkened her face, and her brows contracted.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are pleased to jest!" she said coldly; "As I said before, it is man's
      only way of turning aside, or concluding all argument with a woman! I am
      mistaken perhaps in the instinct which has led me to speak to you as
      openly as I have done,&mdash;and yet,&mdash;I know in my heart I can do
      you no harm by telling you the truth, as others would never tell it to
      you! Many times within this last two months the people have sent in
      petitions to you against the heavy taxes with which your Government is
      afflicting them, and they can get no answer to their desperate appeals. Is
      it kingly&mdash;is it worthy of your post as Head of this realm, to turn a
      deaf ear to the cries of those whose hard-earned money keeps you on the
      Throne, housed in luxury, guarded from every possible evil, and happily
      ignorant of the pangs of want and hunger? How can you, if you have a
      heart, permit such an iniquitous act on the part of your Government as the
      setting of a tax on bread?&mdash;the all in all of life to the very poor!
      Have you ever seen young children crying for bread? I have! Have you ever
      seen strong men reduced to the shame of stealing bread, to feed their
      wives and infants? I have! I think of it as I stand here, surrounded by
      the luxury which is your daily lot,&mdash;and knowing what I know, I would
      strip these satin-draped walls, and sell everything of value around me if
      I possessed it, rather than know that one woman or child starved within
      the city's precincts! Your Ministers tell you there is a deficiency in the
      Exchequer,&mdash;but you do not ask why, or how the deficiency arose! You
      do not ask whether Ministers themselves have not been trafficking and
      speculating with the country's money! For if deficiency there be, it has
      arisen out of the Government's mismanagement! The Government have had the
      people's money,&mdash;and have thrown it recklessly away. Therefore, they
      have no right to ask for more, to supply what they themselves have
      wilfully wasted. No right, I say!&mdash;no right to rob them of another
      coin! If I were a man, and a king like you, I would voluntarily resign
      more than half my annual kingly income to help that deficit in the
      National Exchequer till it had been replaced;&mdash;I would live poor,&mdash;and
      be content to know that by my act I had won far more than many millions&mdash;a
      deathless, and beloved name of honour with my people!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She paused. He said not a word. Suddenly she became conscious that her
      hair was unbound and falling loosely about her; she had almost forgotten
      this till now. A wave of colour swept over her face,&mdash;but she
      mastered her embarrassment, and gathering the long tresses together in her
      left hand, twisted them up slowly, and with an evident painful effort. The
      King watched her, a little smile hovering about his mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If I might help you!" he said softly&mdash;"but&mdash;that is a task for
      my Resemblance!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She appeared not to hear him. A sudden determination moved her, and she
      uttered her thought boldly and at all hazards.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you do not, as the public report, approve of the financial schemes out
      of which your Ministers make their fortunes, to the utter ruin of the
      people in general," she said slowly; "Dismiss Carl Pérousse from office!
      So may you perchance avert a great national disaster!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He permitted himself to smile indulgently.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Madame, you may ask much!&mdash;and however great your demands, I will do
      my utmost to meet and comply with them;&mdash;but like all your charming
      sex, you forget that a king can seldom or never interfere with a political
      situation! It would be very unwise policy on my part to dismiss M.
      Pérousse, seeing that he is already nominated as the next Premier."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The next Premier!" Lotys echoed the words with a passionate scorn; "If
      that is so, I give you an honest warning! The people will revolt,&mdash;no
      force can hold them back or keep them in check! And if you should command
      your soldiery to fire on the populace, there must be bloodshed and crime!&mdash;on
      your head be the result! Oh, are you not, can you not be something higher
      than even a king?&mdash;an honest man? Will you not open the eyes of your
      mind to see the wickedness, falsehood and treachery of this vile Minister,
      who ministers only to his own ends?&mdash;who feigns incorruptibility in
      order to more easily corrupt others?&mdash;who assumes the defence of
      outlying states, merely to hide the depredations he is making on home
      power? Nay, if you will not, you are not worth a beggar's blessing!&mdash;and
      I shall wonder to myself why God made of you so exact a copy of one whom I
      know to be a good man!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Her breath came and went quickly,&mdash;her cheeks were flushed, and great
      tears stood in her eyes. But he seemed altogether unmoved.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I' faith, I shall wonder too!" he said very tranquilly; "Good men are
      scarce!&mdash;and to be the copy of one is excellent, though it may in
      some cases be misleading! Madame, I have heard you with patience, and&mdash;if
      you will permit me to say so&mdash;admiration! I honour your courage&mdash;your
      frankness&mdash;and&mdash;still more&mdash;your absolute independence. You
      speak of wrongs to the People. If such wrongs indeed exist&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "If!" interrupted Lotys with a whole world of meaning in the expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I say, if they indeed exist, I will, as far as I may,&mdash;endeavour to
      remedy them. I, personally, have no hesitation in declaring to you that I
      am not involved in the financial schemes to which you allude&mdash;though
      I know two or three of my fellow-sovereigns who are! But I do not care
      sufficiently for money to indulge in speculation. Nevertheless, let me
      tell you, speculation is good, and even necessary in matters affecting
      national finance, and I am confident&mdash;" here he smiled enigmatically,
      "that the country's honour is safe in the hands of M. Pérousse!"
    </p>
    <p>
      At this she lifted her head proudly and looked at him, with eyes that
      expressed so magnificent a disdain, that had he been any other than the
      man he was, he might have quailed beneath the lightning flash of such
      utter contempt.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are confident that the country's honour is safe!" she repeated
      bitterly; "I am confident that it is betrayed and shamed! And History will
      set a curse against the King who helped in its downfall!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He regarded her with a vague, lingering gentleness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are harsh, Madame!" he said softly; "But you could not offend me if
      you tried! I quarrel with none of your sex! And you will, I hope, think
      better of me some day,&mdash;and not be sorry&mdash;as perhaps you are now&mdash;for
      having saved a life so worthless! Farewell!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She offered no response. The silken portière rustled and swayed,&mdash;the
      door opened and shut again quietly&mdash;he was gone. Left alone, Lotys
      dropped wearily on the sofa, and burying her head in the soft cushions,
      gave way to an outburst of tears and sobbed like a tired and exhausted
      child. In this condition Professor von Glauben, entering presently, found
      her. But his sympathy, if he felt any, was outwardly very chill and
      formal. Another dose of his 'cordial,'&mdash;a careful examination and
      re-strapping of the wounded shoulder,&mdash;these summed up the whole of
      his consolation; and his precise cold manner did much to restore her to
      her self-possession. She thanked him in a few words for his professional
      attention, without raising her eyes to his face, and quietly followed him
      down a long narrow passage which terminated in a small private door giving
      egress to the Royal pleasure-grounds,&mdash;and here a hired close
      carriage was waiting. Putting her carefully into this vehicle, the
      Professor then delivered himself of his last instructions.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The driver has no orders beyond the citadel, Madame," he explained. "His
      Majesty begged me to say that he has no desire to seem inquisitive as to
      your place of residence. You will therefore please inform the coachman
      yourself as to where you wish to be driven. And take care of that
      so-much-wounded shoulder!" he added, relapsing into a kinder and less
      formal tone;&mdash;"It will pain you,&mdash;but there will be no
      inflammation, not now I have treated it!&mdash;and it will heal quickly,
      that I will guarantee&mdash;I, who have had first care of it!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She thanked him again in a low voice,&mdash;there was an uncomfortable
      lump in her throat, and tears still trembled on her lashes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Remember well," said the Professor cheerily; "how very grateful we are to
      you! What we shall do for you some day, we do not yet know! A monument in
      the public square, or a bust in the Cathedral? Ha, ha! Goodbye! You have
      the blessing of the nation with you!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head deprecatingly,&mdash;she tried to smile, but she could
      not trust herself to speak. The carriage rolled swiftly down the broad
      avenue and soon disappeared, and the Professor, having watched the last
      flash of its wheels vanish between the arching trees, executed a slow and
      somewhat solemn <i>pas-seul</i> on the doorstep where it had left him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ach so!" he exclaimed, almost audibly; "The King's Comedy progresses! But
      it had nearly taken the form of Tragedy to-day&mdash;and now Tragedy
      itself has melted into sentiment, and tears, and passion! And with this
      very difficult kind of human mixture, the worst may happen!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He re-entered the Palace and returned with some haste to the apartments of
      the King, whither he had been bidden.
    </p>
    <p>
      But on arriving there he was met by an attendant in the ante-room who
      informed him that his Majesty had retired to his private library and
      desired to be left alone.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXV. &mdash; "I SAY&mdash;'ROME'!"
    </h2>
    <p>
      The State prison was a gloomy fortress built on a wedge of rock that
      jutted far out into the ocean. It stood full-fronted to the north, and had
      opposed its massive walls and huge battlements to every sort of storm for
      many centuries. It was a relic of mediaeval days, when torture no less
      than death, was the daily practice of the law, and when persons were
      punished as cruelly for light offences as for the greatest crimes. It was
      completely honeycombed with dungeons and subterranean passages, which led
      to the sea,&mdash;and in one of the darkest and deepest of these
      underground cells, the wretched youth who had attempted the life of the
      King, was placed under the charge of two armed warders, who marched up and
      down outside the heavily-barred door, keeping close watch and guard.
      Neither they nor anyone else had exchanged a word with the prisoner since
      his arrest. He had given them no trouble. He had been carefully searched,
      but nothing of an incriminating nature had been found upon him,&mdash;nothing
      to point to any possible instigator of his dastard crime. He had entered
      the dungeon allotted to him with almost a cheerful air,&mdash;he had
      muttered half-inaudible thanks for the bread and water which had been
      passed to him through the grating; and he had seated himself upon the cold
      bench, hewn out of the stone wall, with a resignation that might have
      easily passed for pleasure. As the time wore on, however, and the reality
      of his position began to press more consciously upon his senses, the
      warders heard him sigh deeply, and move restlessly, and once he gave a cry
      like that of a wounded animal, exclaiming:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "For Thy sake, Lord Christ! For Thy sake I strove&mdash;for Thy sake, and
      in Thy service! Thou wilt not leave me here to perish!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He had been brought to the prison immediately after his murderous attack,
      and the time had then been about four in the afternoon. It was now night;
      and all over the city the joy-bells were clashing out music from the
      Cathedral towers, to express the popular thanksgiving for the miraculous
      escape and safety of the King. The echo of the chimes which had been
      ringing ever since sunset, was caught by the sea and thrown back again
      upon the air, so that it partially drowned the melancholy clang of the
      prison bell, which in its turn, tolled forth the dreary passing of the
      time for those to whom liberty had become the merest shadow of a dream. As
      it struck nine, a priest presented himself to the Superintendent of the
      prison, bearing a 'permit' from General Bernhoff, Head of the Police, to
      visit and 'confess' the prisoner. He was led to the cell and admitted at
      once. At the noise of a stranger's entrance, the criminal raised himself
      from the sunken attitude into which he had fallen on his stone bench, and
      watched, by the light of the dim lamp set in the wall, the approach of his
      tall, gaunt, black-garmented visitor with evident horror and fear. When,&mdash;with
      the removal of the shovel hat and thick muffler which had helped to
      disguise that visitor's personality,&mdash;the features of Monsignor Del
      Fortis were disclosed, he sprang forward and threw himself on his knees.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mercy!&mdash;Mercy!" he moaned&mdash;"Have pity on me, in the name of
      God!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Del Fortis looked down upon him with contempt, as though he were some
      loathsome reptile writhing at his feet. "Silence!" he said, in a harsh
      whisper&mdash;"Remember, we are watched here! Get up!&mdash;why do you
      kneel to <i>me</i>? I have nothing to do with you, beyond such office as
      the Church enjoins!" And a cold smile darkened, rather than lightened his
      features. "I am sent to administer 'spiritual consolation' to you!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Slowly the prisoner struggled up to a standing posture, and pressing both
      hands to his head, he stared wildly before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Spiritual consolation'!" he muttered-"'Spiritual'?" A faint dull vacuous
      smile flickered over his face, and he shuddered. "I understand! You come
      to prepare my soul for Heaven!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Del Fortis gave him a sinister look.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That depends on yourself!" he replied curtly&mdash;"The Church can speed
      you either way,&mdash;to Heaven, or&mdash;Hell!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The prisoner's hands clenched involuntarily with a gesture of despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know that!" he said sullenly&mdash;"The Church can save or kill! What
      of it? I am now beyond even the power of the Church!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Del Fortis seated himself on the stone bench.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come here!" he said&mdash;"Sit down beside me!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The prisoner obeyed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Look at this!"&mdash;and he drew an ebony and silver crucifix from his
      breast&mdash;"Fix your eyes upon it, and try, my son,"&mdash;here he
      raised his voice a little&mdash;"try to conquer your thoughts of things
      temporal, and lift them to the things which are eternal! For things
      temporal do quickly vanish and disperse, but things eternal shall endure
      for ever! Humble your soul before God, and beseech Him with me, to
      mercifully cleanse the dark stain of sin upon your soul!" Here he began
      mumbling a Latin prayer, and while engaged in this, he caught the
      prisoner's hand in a close grip. "Act&mdash;act with me!" he said firmly.
      "Fool!&mdash;Play a part, as I do! Bend your head close to mine&mdash;assume
      shame and sorrow even if you cannot feel it! And listen to me well! <i>You
      have failed</i>!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know it!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The reply came thick and low.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why did you make the attempt at all? Who persuaded you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The wretched youth lifted his head, and showed a wild white face, in which
      the piteous eyes, starting from their sockets, looked blind with terror.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who persuaded me?" he replied mechanically&mdash;"No one! No single one,&mdash;but
      many!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Del Fortis gripped him firmly by the wrist.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You lie!" he snarled&mdash;"How dare you utter such a calumny! Who were
      you? What were you? A miserable starveling&mdash;picked up from the
      streets and saved from penury,&mdash;housed and sheltered in our College,&mdash;taught
      and trained and given paid employment by us,&mdash;what have <i>you</i> to
      say of 'persuasion'?&mdash;you, who owe your very life to us, and to our
      charity!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Roused by this attack, the prisoner, wrenching his hand away from the
      priest's cruel grasp, sprang upright.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wait&mdash;wait!" he said breathlessly&mdash;"You do not understand! You
      forget! All my life I have been under One great influence&mdash;all my
      life I have been taught to dream One great Dream! When I talk of
      'persuasion,' I only mean the persuasion of that force which has
      surrounded me as closely as the air I breathe!&mdash;that spirit which is
      bound to enter into all who work for you, or with you! Oh no!&mdash;neither
      you nor any member of your Order ever seek openly to 'persuade' any man to
      any act, whether good or evil&mdash;your Rule is much wiser than that!&mdash;much
      more subtle! You issue no actual commands&mdash;your power comes chiefly
      by suggestion! And <i>with</i> you,&mdash;working <i>for</i> you&mdash;I
      have thought day and night, night and day, of the glory of Rome!&mdash;the
      dominion of Rome!&mdash;the triumph of Rome! I have learned, under you, to
      wish for it, to pray for it, to desire it more than my own life!&mdash;do
      you, can you blame me for that? You dare not call it a sin;&mdash;for your
      Order represents it as a virtue that condones all sin!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Del Fortis was silent, watching him with a kind of curious contempt.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It grew to be part of me, this Dream!" went on the lad, his eyes now
      shining with a feverish brilliancy&mdash;"And I began to see wonderful
      visions, and to hear voices calling me in the daytime,&mdash;voices that
      no one else heard! Once in the College chapel I saw the Blessed Virgin's
      picture smile! I was copying documents for the Vatican then,&mdash;and I
      thought of the Holy Father,&mdash;how he was imprisoned in Rome, when he
      should be Emperor of all the Emperors,&mdash;King of all the Kings! I
      remembered how it was that he had no temporal power,&mdash;though all the
      powers of the earth should be subservient to him!&mdash;and my heart beat
      almost to bursting, and my brain seemed on fire!&mdash;but the Blessed
      Virgin's picture still smiled;&mdash;and I knelt down before it and swore
      that I,&mdash;even I, would help to give the whole world back to Rome,
      even if I died for it!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He caught his breath with a kind of sob, and looked appealingly at Del
      Fortis, who, fingering the crucifix he held, sat immovable.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And then&mdash;and then" he went on, "I heard enough,&mdash;while at work
      in the monastery with you and the brethren,&mdash;to strengthen and fire
      my resolution. I learned that all kings are, in these days, the enemies of
      the Church. I learned that they were all united in one resolve; and that,&mdash;to
      deprive the Holy Father of temporal power! Then I set myself to study
      kings. Each, and all of those who sit on thrones to-day passed before my
      view;&mdash;all selfish, money-seeking, sensual men!&mdash;not one good,
      true soul among them! Demons they seemed to me,&mdash;bent on depriving
      God's Evangelist in Rome of his Sacred and Supreme Sovereignty! It made me
      mad!&mdash;and I would have killed all kings, could I have done so with a
      single thought! Then came a day when you preached openly in the Cathedral
      against this one King, who should by right have gone to his account this
      very afternoon!&mdash;you told the people how he had refused lands to the
      Church,&mdash;and how by this wicked act he had stopped the progress of
      religious education, and had put himself, as it were, in the way of Christ
      who said: 'Suffer little children to come unto Me!' And my dreams of the
      glory of Rome again took shape&mdash;I saw in my mind all the children,&mdash;the
      poor little children of the world, gathered to the knee of the Holy
      Father, and brought up to obey him and him only!&mdash;I remembered my
      oath before the Blessed Virgin's picture, and all my soul cried out:
      'Death to the crowned Tyrant! Death!' For you said&mdash;and I believed it&mdash;that
      all who opposed the Holy Father's will, were opposed to the will of God!&mdash;and
      over and over again I said in my heart: 'Death to the tyrant! Death!' And
      the words went with me like the response of a litany,&mdash;till&mdash;till&mdash;I
      saw him before me to-day&mdash;a pampered fool, surrounded by women!&mdash;a
      blazoned liar!&mdash;and then&mdash;" He paused, smiling foolishly; and
      shaking his head with a slow movement to and fro, he added&mdash;"The
      dagger should have struck home!&mdash;it was aimed surely&mdash;aimed
      strongly!&mdash;but that woman came between&mdash;why did she come? They
      said she was Lotys!&mdash;ha ha!&mdash;Lotys, the Revolutionary sybil!&mdash;Lotys,
      the Socialist!&mdash;but that could not be,&mdash;Lotys is as great an
      enemy of kings as I am!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And an enemy of the Church as well!" said Del Fortis harshly&mdash;"Between
      the Church and Socialism, all Thrones stand on a cracking earth, devoured
      by fire! But make no mistake about it!&mdash;the woman was Lotys!
      Socialist and Revolutionary as she may be, she has saved the life of the
      King. This is so far fortunate&mdash;for you! And it is much to be hoped
      that she herself is not slain by your dagger thrust;&mdash;death is far
      too easy and light a punishment for her and her associates! We trust it
      may please a merciful God to visit her with more lingering calamity!"
    </p>
    <p>
      As he said this, he piously kissed the crucifix he held, keeping his
      shallow dark eyes fixed on the prisoner with the expression of a cat
      watching a mouse. The half-crazed youth, absorbed in the ideas of his own
      dementia, still smiled to himself vaguely, and nervously plucked at his
      fingers, till Del Fortis, growing impatient and forgetting for the moment
      that they stood in a prison cell, the interior of which might possibly be
      seen and watched from many points of observation unknown to them, went up
      to him and shook him roughly by the arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Attention!" he said angrily&mdash;"Rouse yourself and hear me! You talk
      like a fool or a madman,&mdash;yet you are neither&mdash;neither, you
      understand?&mdash;neither idiot-born nor suddenly crazed;&mdash;so, when
      on your trial do not feign to be what you are not! Such ideas as you have
      expressed, though they may have their foundation in a desire for good, are
      evil in their results&mdash;yet even out of evil good may come! The power
      of Rome&mdash;the glory of Rome&mdash;the dominion of Rome! Rome, supreme
      Mistress of the world! Would you help the Church to win this great
      victory? Then now is your chance! God has given you&mdash;you, His poor
      instrument,&mdash;the means to effectually aid His conquest,&mdash;to Him
      be all the praise and thanksgiving! It rests with you to accept His
      message and perform His work!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The high-flown, melodramatic intensity with which he pronounced these
      words, had the desired effect on the stunned and bewildered, weak mind of
      the unfortunate lad so addressed. His eyes sparkled&mdash;his cheeks
      flushed,&mdash;and he looked eagerly up into the face of his priestly
      hypnotizer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes&mdash;yes!" he said quickly in a breathless whisper&mdash;"But how?&mdash;tell
      me how! I will work&mdash;oh, I will work&mdash;for Rome, for God, for the
      Blessed Virgin!&mdash;I will do all that I can!&mdash;but how&mdash;how?
      Will the Holy Father send an angel to take me out of this prison, so that
      I may be free to help God?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Del Fortis surveyed him with a kind of grim derision, A slight noise like
      the slipping-back or slipping-to of a grating, startled him, and he looked
      about him on all sides, moved by a sudden nervous apprehension. But the
      massive walls of the cell, oozing with damp and slime, had apparently no
      aperture or outlet anywhere, not even a slit in the masonry for the
      admission of daylight. Satisfied with his hasty examination, he took his
      credulous victim by the arm, and led him back to the rough stone bench
      where they had first begun to converse.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Kneel down here before me!"&mdash;he said&mdash;"Kneel, as if you were
      repeating all the sins of your life to me in your last confession! Kneel,
      I say!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Feebly, and with trembling limbs, the lad obeyed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now," continued Del Fortis, holding up the crucifix before him&mdash;"Try
      to follow my words and understand them! To-morrow, or the next day, you
      will be taken before a judge and tried for your attempted crime. Do you
      realise that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do!" The answer came hesitatingly, and with a faint moan.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you thought what you intend to say when you are asked your reasons
      for attacking the King? Do you mean to tell judge and jury the story of
      what you call your 'persuasion' to dream of the dominion of Rome?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes&mdash;yes!" replied the lad, looking up with an eager light on his
      face&mdash;"Yes, I will tell them all,&mdash;just as I have told you! Then
      they will know,&mdash;they will see that it was a good thought of mine&mdash;it
      would have been a good sin! I will speak to them of the wicked wrongs done
      to you and your Holy Order,&mdash;of the cruelty which the Christian
      Apostle in Rome has to suffer at the hands of kings&mdash;and they will
      acknowledge me to be right and just;&mdash;they will know I am as a man
      inspired by God to work for the Church, the bride of Christ, and to make
      her Queen of all the world!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He stopped suddenly, intimidated by the cruel glare of the wolfish eyes
      above him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will say nothing of all this!" and Del Fortis shook the crucifix in
      his face as though it were a threatening weapon; "You will say only what
      <i>I</i> choose,&mdash;only what <i>I</i> command! And if you do not swear
      to speak as I tell you, I will kill you!&mdash;here and now&mdash;with my
      own hands!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Uttering a half-smothered cry, the wretched youth recoiled in terror.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will kill me? You&mdash;<i>you</i>?" he gasped&mdash;"No&mdash;no!&mdash;you
      could not do that! you could not,&mdash;you are a holy man! I&mdash;I am
      not afraid that you will hurt me! I have done nothing to offend you,&mdash;I
      have always been obedient to you,&mdash;I have been your slave&mdash;your
      dog to fetch and carry!&mdash;and you should remember,&mdash;yes!&mdash;you
      should remember that my mother was rich,&mdash;and that because she too
      felt the call of God, she gave all her money to the Church, and left me
      thrown upon the streets to starve! But the Church rescued me&mdash;the
      Church did not forget! And I am ready to serve the Church in all and every
      possible way,&mdash;I have done my best, even now!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He spoke with all the passionate self-persuasion of a fanatic, and Del
      Fortis judged it wisest to control his own fierce inward impatience and
      deal with him more restrainedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is true enough!" he said in milder accents;&mdash;"You are ready to
      serve the Church,&mdash;I do not doubt it;&mdash;but you do not serve it
      in the right way. No earthly good is gained to us by the killing of kings!
      Their conversion and obedience is what we seek. This king you would have
      slain is a baptised son of the Church; but beyond attending mass regularly
      in his private chapel, which he does for the mere sake of appearances, he
      is an atheist, condemned to the fires of Hell. Nevertheless, no advantage
      to us could possibly be obtained by his death. Much can be done for us by
      you&mdash;yes, <i>you</i>!&mdash;and much will depend on the answers to
      the questions asked you at your trial. Give those answers as <i>I</i>
      shall bid you, and you will win a triumph for the cause of Rome!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The prisoner's eyes glittered feverishly,&mdash;full of the delirium of
      bigotry, he caught the lean, cold hand that held the crucifix, and kissed
      it fervently.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Command me!" he muttered&mdash;"Command!&mdash;and in the name of the
      Blessed Virgin, I will obey!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hear then, and attend closely to my words," went on Del Fortis,
      enunciating his sentences in a low distinct voice&mdash;"When you are
      brought before the judge, you will be accused of an attempt to assassinate
      the King. Make no denial of it,&mdash;admit it at once, and express
      contrition. You will then be asked if any person or persons instigated you
      to commit the crime. To this say 'yes'!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Say 'yes'!" repeated the lad&mdash;"But that will not be true!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Fool, does it matter!" ejaculated Del Fortis, almost savagely&mdash;"Have
      you not sworn to speak as I command you? What is it to you whether it is
      true or false?"
    </p>
    <p>
      A slight shiver passed through the prisoner's limbs&mdash;but he was
      silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Say"&mdash;went on his pitiless instructor&mdash;"that you were enticed
      and persuaded to commit the wicked deed by the teachings of the Socialist,
      Sergius Thord, and his followers. Say that the woman Lotys knew of your
      intention,&mdash;and saved the life of the King at the last moment,
      through fear, lest her own seditious schemes should be discovered and
      herself punished. Say,&mdash;that because you were young and weak and
      impressionable, she chose you out to attempt the assassination. Do you
      hear?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hear!" The reply came thickly and almost inaudibly. "But must I tell
      these lies? I have never spoken to Sergius Thord in my life!&mdash;nor to
      the woman Lotys;&mdash;I know nothing of them or their followers, except
      by the public talk;&mdash;why should I harm the innocent? Let me tell the
      truth, I pray of you!&mdash;let me speak as my heart dictates!&mdash;let
      me plead for the Holy Father&mdash;for you&mdash;for your Order&mdash;for
      the Church!&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      He broke off as Del Fortis caught him by both hands in an angry grip.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do not dare to speak one word of the Church!" he said, "Or of us,&mdash;or
      of our Order! Let not a single syllable escape your lips concerning your
      connection with us and our Society!&mdash;or we shall find means to make
      you regret it! Beware of betraying yourself! When you are once before the
      Court of Law, remember you know nothing of Us, our Work, or our Creed!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Utterly bewildered and mystified, the unhappy youth rocked himself to and
      fro, clasping and unclasping his hands in a kind of nervous paroxysm.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh why, why will you bid me to do this?" he moaned&mdash;"You know there
      are times when I cannot be answerable for myself! How can I tell what I
      shall do when I am brought face to face with my accusers?&mdash;when I see
      all the dreadful eyes of the people turned upon me? How can I deny all
      knowledge of those who brought me up, and nurtured and educated me? If
      they ask me of my home, is it not with you?&mdash;under your sufferance
      and charity? If they seek to know my means of subsistence, is it not
      through you that I receive the copying-work for which I am paid? You would
      not have me repudiate all this, would you? I should be worse than a dog in
      sheer ingratitude if I did not bear open testimony to all the Church has
      done for me!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Be, not worse than a dog, but faithful as a dog in obedience!" responded
      Del Fortis impressively&mdash;"And, for once, speak of the Church with the
      indifference of an atheist,&mdash;or with such marked coldness as a wise
      man speaks of the woman he secretly adores! Hold the Church and Us too
      sacred for any mention in a Court of criminal law! But serve the Church by
      involving the Socialist and Revolutionary party! Think of the magnificent
      results which will spring from this act,&mdash;and nerve yourself to tell
      a lie in order to support a truth!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Rising unsteadily from his knees, the prisoner stood upright. By the
      flicker of the dim lamp, he looked deadly pale, and his limbs tottered as
      though shaken by an ague fit.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What good will come of it?" he queried dully&mdash;"What good <i>can</i>
      come of it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Great and lasting good will come of it!"&mdash;replied Del Fortis&mdash;"And
      it will come quickly too;&mdash;in this way, for by fastening the
      accusation of undue influence on Sergius Thord and his companions, you
      will obtain Government restriction, if not total suppression of the
      Socialist party. This is what we need! The Socialists are growing too
      strong&mdash;too powerful in every country,&mdash;and we are on the brink
      of trouble through their accursed and atheistical demonstrations. There
      will soon be serious disturbances in the political arena&mdash;possibly an
      overthrow of the Government, and a general election&mdash;and if Sergius
      Thord has the chance of advancing himself as a deputy, he will be elected
      above all others by an overpowering majority of the lower classes. <i>You</i>
      can prevent this!&mdash;you can prevent it by a single falsehood, which in
      this case will be more pleasing to God than a thousand mischievous
      veracities! Will you do it? Yes or No?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The miserable lad looked helplessly around him, his weak frame trembling
      as with palsy, and his uncertain fingers plucking at each other with that
      involuntary movement of the muscles which indicates a disordered brain.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will you, or will you not?" reiterated Del Fortis in a whisper that
      hissed through the close precincts of the cell like the warning of a snake
      about to sting&mdash;"Answer me!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Suppose I say I will not!"&mdash;stammered the poor wretch, with
      trembling lips and appealing eyes&mdash;"Suppose I say I will not falsely
      accuse the innocent, even for the sake of the Church&mdash;&mdash;?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then," said Del Fortis slowly, rising and moving towards him;&mdash;"You
      had best accept the only alternative&mdash;this!"
    </p>
    <p>
      And he took from his breast pocket a small phial, full of clear,
      colourless fluid, and showed it to him&mdash;"Take it!&mdash;and so make a
      quick and quiet end! For, if you betray you connection with Us by so much
      as a look,&mdash;a sign, or a syllable,&mdash;your mode of exit from this
      world may be slower, less decent, and more painful!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The miserable boy wrung his hands in agony, and such a cry of despair
      broke from his lips as might have moved anyone less cruelly made of
      spiritual adamant than the determined servant of the cruellest 'religious'
      Order known. The dull harsh clang of the prison bell struck ten. The
      'priest' had been an hour at the work of 'confessing' his penitent,&mdash;and
      his patience was well-nigh exhausted.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Swear you will attribute your intended assassination of the King, to the
      influence of the Socialists!" he said with fierce imperativeness&mdash;"Or
      with this&mdash;end all your difficulties to-night! It is a gentle
      quietus!&mdash;and you ought to thank me for it! It is better than
      solitary imprisonment for life! I will give you absolution for taking it&mdash;provided
      I see you swallow it before I go!&mdash;and I will declare to the Church
      that I left you shrived of your sins, and clean! Half an hour after I
      leave you, you will sleep!&mdash;and wake&mdash;in Heaven! Make your
      choice!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The last words had scarcely left his lips when the cell door was suddenly
      thrown open, and a blaze of light poured in. Dazzled by the strong and
      sudden glare, Del Fortis recoiled, and still holding the phial of poison
      in his hand, stumbled back against the half-fainting form of the poor
      crazed creature he had been terrorising, as a dozen armed men silently
      entered the dungeon and ranged themselves in order, six on one side and
      six on the other, while, in their midst one man advanced, throwing back
      his dark military cloak as he came, and displaying a mass of jewelled
      orders and insignia on his brilliant uniform. Del Fortis uttered a fierce
      oath.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The King!" he muttered, under his breath&mdash;"The King!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ay, the King!" and a glance of supreme scorn swept over him from head to
      foot, as the monarch's clear dark grey eyes flashed with the glitter of
      cold steel in the luminance of the torches which were carried by
      attendants behind him; "Monsignor Del Fortis! You stand convicted of the
      offence of unlawfully tampering with the conscience of a prisoner of
      State! We have heard your every word&mdash;and have obtained a bird's-eye
      view of your policy!&mdash;so that,&mdash;if necessary,&mdash;we will
      Ourselves bear witness against you! For the present,&mdash;you will be
      detained in this fortress until our further pleasure!"
    </p>
    <p>
      For one moment Del Fortis appeared to be literally contorted in every
      muscle by his excess of rage. His features grew livid,&mdash;his eyes
      became almost blood-red, and his teeth met on his drawn-in under-lip in a
      smile of intense malignity. Baffled again!&mdash;and by this 'king,'&mdash;the
      crowned Dummy,&mdash;who had cast aside all former precedent, and instead
      of amusing himself with card-playing and sensual intrigue, after the
      accepted fashion of most modern sovereigns, had presumed to interfere, not
      only with the Church, but with the Government, and now, as it seemed, had
      acted as a spy on the very secrets of a so-called prison 'confession'! The
      utter impossibility of escaping from the net into which his own words had
      betrayed him, stood plainly before his mind and half-choked him with
      impotent fury,&mdash;till&mdash;all suddenly a thought crossed his brain
      like a flash of fire, and with a strong effort, he recovered his
      self-possession. Crossing his arms meekly on his breast, he bowed with a
      silent and profound affectation of humility, as one who is bent under the
      Royal displeasure, yet resigned to the Royal command,&mdash;then with a
      rapid movement he lifted the poison-phial he had held concealed, to his
      lips. His action was at once perceived. Two or three of the armed guards
      threw themselves upon him and, after a brief struggle, wrenched the flask
      from his hand, but not till he had succeeded in swallowing its contents.
      Breathing quickly, yet smiling imperturbably, he stood upright and calm.
    </p>
    <p>
      "God's will and mine&mdash;not your Majesty's&mdash;be done!" he said. "In
      half an hour&mdash;or less&mdash;Mother Church may add to her list of
      martyrs the name of Andrea Del Fortis!&mdash;who died rather than
      sacrifice the dignity of his calling to the tyranny of a king!"
    </p>
    <p>
      A slight convulsion passed over his features,&mdash;he staggered backward.
      The King, horror-stricken, signed to the prison warders standing by, to
      support him. He muttered a word of thanks, as they caught him by both
      arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Take me where I can die quietly!" he said to them, "It will soon be over!
      I shall give you little trouble!"
    </p>
    <p>
      A cold, weak, trembling hand clasped his. It was the hand of the King's
      wretched assassin.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let me go with you!" he cried&mdash;"Let me die with you! You have been
      cruel to me!&mdash;but you could not have meant it!&mdash;you were once
      kind!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Del Fortis thrust him aside.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Curse you!" he said thickly&mdash;"You are the cause&mdash;you&mdash;you
      are the cause of this damned mischief! You!&mdash;God!&mdash;to think of
      it!&mdash;you devil's spawn!&mdash;you cur!"
    </p>
    <p>
      His voice failed him, and he reeled heavily against the sturdy form of one
      of the warders who held him&mdash;his lips were flecked with blood and
      foam. Shocked and appalled, no less at his words, than at the fiendish
      contortion of his features, the King drew near.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Curse not a fellow-mortal, unhappy priest, in thine own passage towards
      the final judgment!" he said in grave accents&mdash;"The blessing of this
      poor misguided creature may help thee more than even a king's free
      pardon!"
    </p>
    <p>
      And he extended his hand;&mdash;but with all the force of his now
      struggling and convulsed body, Del Fortis beat it back, and raised himself
      by an almost superhuman effort.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pardon! Who talks of pardon!" he cried, with a strong voice&mdash;"I do
      not need it&mdash;I do not seek it! I have worked for the Church&mdash;I
      die for the Church! For every one that says 'The King!'&mdash;I say,
      'Rome'!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He drew himself stiffly upright; his dark eyes glittered; his face, though
      deadly pale, scarcely looked like the face of a dying man.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I say, 'Rome'!" he repeated, in a harsh whisper;&mdash;"Over all the
      world!&mdash;over all the kingdoms of the world, and in defiance of all
      kings&mdash;'Rome'!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He fell back,&mdash;not dead,&mdash;but insensible, in the stupor which
      precedes death;&mdash;and was quickly borne out of the cell and carried to
      the prison infirmary, there to receive medical aid, though that could only
      now avail to soothe the approaching agonies of dissolution.
    </p>
    <p>
      The King stood mute and motionless, lost in thought, a heavy darkness
      brooding on his features. How strange the impulse that had led him to be
      the mover and witness of this scene! By merest chance he had learned that
      Del Fortis had applied for permission to 'confess' the would-be destroyer
      of his life,&mdash;the life which Lotys had saved,&mdash;and acting&mdash;as
      he had lately accustomed himself to do&mdash;on a sudden first idea or
      instinct, he had summoned General Bernhoff to escort him to the prison,
      and make the way easy for him to watch and overhear the interview between
      priest and penitent,&mdash;himself unobserved. And from so slight an
      incident had sprung a tragedy,&mdash;which might have results as yet
      undreamed-of!
    </p>
    <p>
      And while he yet mused upon this, General Bernhoff ventured respectfully
      to approach him, and ask if it was now his pleasure to return to the
      Palace? He roused himself,&mdash;and with a heavy sigh looked round on the
      damp and dismal cell in which he stood, and at the crouching,
      fear-stricken form of the semi-crazed and now violently weeping lad who
      had attempted his life.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Take that poor wretch away from here!" he said in hushed tones&mdash;"Give
      him light, and warmth, and food! His evil desires spring from an unsound
      brain;&mdash;I would have him dealt with mercifully! Guard him with all
      necessary and firm restraint,&mdash;but do not brutalise his body more
      than Rome has brutalised his soul!"
    </p>
    <p>
      With that he turned away,&mdash;and his armed guard and attendants
      followed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      That self-same midnight a requiem mass was sung in a certain chapel before
      a silent gathering of black-robed stern-featured men, who prayed "For the
      repose of the soul of our dear brother, Andrea Del Fortis, servant of God,
      and martyr to the cause of truth and justice,&mdash;who departed this life
      suddenly, in the performance of his sacred duties." In the newspapers next
      day, the death of this same martyr and shining light of the Church was
      recorded with much paid-for regret and press-eulogy as 'due to
      heart-failure' and his body being claimed by the Jesuit brotherhood, it
      was buried with great pomp and solemn circumstance, several of the
      Catholic societies and congregations following it to the grave. One week
      after the funeral,&mdash;for no other ostensible cause whatever, save the
      offence of openly publishing his official refusal of a grant of Crown
      lands to the Jesuits,&mdash;the Holy Father, the Evangelist and Infallible
      Apostle enthroned in St. Peter's Chair, launched against the King who had
      dared to deny his wish and oppose his will, the once terrible, but now
      futile ban of excommunication; and the Royal son of the Church who had
      honestly considered the good of his people more than the advancement of
      priestcraft, stood outside the sacred pale,&mdash;barred by a so-called
      'Christian' creed, from the mercy of God and the hope of Heaven.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXVI. &mdash; "ONE WAY,&mdash;ONE WOMAN!"
    </h2>
    <p>
      For several days after the foregoing events, the editors and proprietors
      of newspapers had more than enough 'copy' to keep them busy. The narrow
      escape of the King from assassination, followed by his excommunication
      from the Church, worked a curious effect on the minds of the populace, who
      were somewhat bewildered and uncertain as to the possible undercurrent of
      political meaning flowing beneath the conjunction of these two events; and
      their feelings were intensified by the announcement that the youth who had
      attempted the monarch's life,&mdash;being proved as suffering from
      hereditary brain disease,&mdash;had received a free pardon, and was placed
      in a suitable home for the treatment of such cases, under careful
      restraint and medical supervision. The tide of popular opinion was now
      divided into two ways,&mdash;for, and against their Sovereign-ruler. By
      far the larger half were against;&mdash;but the ban pronounced upon him by
      the Pope had the effect of making even this disaffected portion inclined
      to consider him more favourably,&mdash;seeing that the Church's punishment
      had fallen upon him, apparently because he had done his duty, as a king,
      by granting the earnest petitions of thousands of his subjects. David
      Jost, who had always made a point of flattering Royalty in all its forms,
      now let his pen go with a complete passion of toadyism, such as disgraced
      certain writers in Great Britain during the reigns of the pernicious and
      vicious Georges,&mdash;and, seeing the continued success of the rival
      journal which the King had personally favoured, he trimmed his sails to
      the Court breeze, and dropped the Church party as though it had burned his
      fingers. But he found various channels on which he had previously relied
      for information, rigorously closed to him. He had written many times to
      the Marquis de Lutera to ask if the report of his having sent in his
      resignation was correct,&mdash;but he had received no answer. He had
      called over and over again on Carl Pérousse, hoping to obtain a few
      minutes' conversation with him, but had been denied an interview.
      Cogitating upon these changes,&mdash;which imported much,&mdash;and
      wishing over and over again that he had been born an Englishman, so that
      by the insidious flattery of Royalty he might obtain a peerage,&mdash;as a
      certain Jew associate of his concerned in the same business in London, had
      recently succeeded in doing,&mdash;he decided that the wisest course to
      follow was to continue to 'butter' the King;&mdash;hence he laid it on
      with a thick brush, wherever the grease of hypocrisy could show off best.
      But work as he would, the 'shares' in his journalistic concerns were
      steadily going down,&mdash;none of his numerous magazines or 'half-penny
      rags,' paid so well as they had hitherto done; while the one paper which
      had lately been so prominently used by the King, continued to prosper, the
      public having now learned to accept with avidity and eagerness the
      brilliant articles which bore the signature of Pasquin Leroy, as though
      they were somewhat of a new political gospel. The charm of mystery
      intensified this new writer's reputation. He was never seen in
      'fashionable' society,&mdash;no 'fashionable' person appeared to know him,&mdash;and
      the general impression was that he resided altogether out of the country.
      Only the members of the Revolutionary Committee were aware that he was one
      of them, and recognised his work as part of the carrying out of his sworn
      bond. He had grown to be almost the right hand of Sergius Thord; wherever
      Thord sought supporters, he helped to obtain them,&mdash;wherever the sick
      and needy, the desolate and distressed, required aid, he somehow managed
      to secure it,&mdash;and next to Thord,&mdash;and of course Lotys,&mdash;he
      was the idol of the Socialist centre. He never spoke in public,&mdash;he
      seldom appeared at mass meetings; but his influence was always felt; and
      he made himself and his work almost a necessity to the Cause. The action
      of Lotys in saving the life of the King, had created considerable
      discussion among the Revolutionists, not unmixed with anger. When she
      first appeared among them after the incident, with her arm in a sling, she
      was greeted with mingled cheers and groans, to neither of which she paid
      the slightest attention. She took her seat at the head of the Committee
      table as usual, with her customary indifference and grace, and appeared
      deaf to the conflicting murmurs around her,&mdash;till, as they grew
      louder and more complaining and insistent, she raised her head and sent
      the lightning flash of her blue eyes down the double line of men with a
      sweeping scorn that instantly silenced them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you seek from me?" she demanded;&mdash;"Why do you clamour like
      babes for something you cannot get,&mdash;my obedience?"
    </p>
    <p>
      They looked shamefacedly at one another,&mdash;then at Sergius Thord and
      Pasquin Leroy, who sat side by side at the lower end of the table. Max
      Graub and Axel Regor, Leroy's two comrades, were for once absent; but they
      had sent suitable and satisfactory excuses. Thord's brows were heavy and
      lowering,&mdash;his eyes were wild and unrestful, and his attitude and
      expression were such as caused Leroy to watch him with a little more than
      his usual close attention. Seeing that his companions expected him to
      answer Lotys before them all, he spoke with evident effort.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You make a difficult demand upon us, Lotys," he said slowly, "if you wish
      us to explain the stormy nature of our greeting to you this evening. You
      might surely have understood it without a question! For we are compelled
      to blame you;&mdash;you who have never till now deserved blame,&mdash;for
      the folly of your action in exposing your own life to save that of the
      King! The one is valuable to us&mdash;the other is nothing to us! Besides,
      you have trespassed against the Seventh Rule of our Order&mdash;which
      solemnly pledges us to 'destroy the present monarchy'!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah!" said Lotys, "And is it part of the oath that the monarchy should be
      destroyed by murder without warning? You know it is not! You know that
      there is nothing more dastardly, more cowardly, more utterly loathsome and
      contemptible than to kill a man defenceless and unarmed! We speak of a
      Monarchy, not a King;&mdash;not one single individual,&mdash;for if he
      were killed, he has three sons to come after him. You have called me the
      Soul of an Ideal&mdash;good! But I am not, and will not be the Soul of a
      Murder-Committee!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well spoken!" said Johan Zegota, looking up from some papers which he, as
      secretary to the Society, had been docketing for the convenience of
      Thord's perusal; "But do not forget, brave Lotys, that the very next
      meeting we hold is the annual one, in which we draw lots for the 'happy
      dispatch' of traitors and false rulers; and that this year the name of the
      King is among them!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Lotys grew a shade paler, but she replied at once and dauntlessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do not forget it! But if lots are cast and traitors doomed,&mdash;it is
      part of our procedure to give any such doomed man six months' steady and
      repeated warning, that he may have time to repent of his mistakes and
      remedy them, so that haply he may still be spared;&mdash;and also that he
      may take heed to arm himself, that he do not die defenceless. Had I not
      saved the King, his death would have been set down to us, and our work!
      Any one of you might have been accused of influencing the crazy boy who
      attempted the deed,&mdash;and it is quite possible our meetings would have
      been suppressed, and all our work fatally hindered,&mdash;if not entirely
      stopped. Foolish children! You should thank me, not blame me!&mdash;but
      you are blind children all, and cannot even see where you have been
      faithfully served by your faithfullest friend!"
    </p>
    <p>
      At these words a new light appeared to break on the minds of all present&mdash;a
      light that was reflected in their eager and animated faces. The knotted
      line of Thord's brooding brows smoothed itself gradually away.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Was that indeed your thought, Lotys," he asked gently, almost tenderly&mdash;"Was
      it for our sakes and for us alone, that you saved the King?"
    </p>
    <p>
      At that instant Pasquin Leroy turned his eyes, which till now had been
      intent on watching Thord, to the other end of the table where the fine,
      compact woman's head, framed in its autumn-gold hair, was silhouetted
      against the dark background of the wall behind her like a cameo. His gaze
      met hers,&mdash;and a vague look of fear and pain flashed over her face,
      as a faint touch of colour reddened her cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am not accustomed to repeat my words, Sergius Thord!" she answered
      coldly; "I have said my say!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Looks were exchanged, and there was a silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If we doubt Lotys, we doubt the very spirit of ourselves!" said Pasquin
      Leroy, his rich voice thrilling with unwonted emotion; "Sergius&mdash;and
      comrades all! If you will hear me, and believe me,&mdash;you may take my
      word for it, she has run the risk of death for Us!&mdash;and has saved Us
      from false accusation, and Government interference! To wrong Lotys by so
      much as a thought, is to wrong the truest woman God ever made!"
    </p>
    <p>
      A wild shout answered him,&mdash;and moved by one impulse, the whole body
      of men rose to their feet and drank "to the health and honour of Lotys!"
      with acclamation, many of them afterwards coming round to where she sat,
      and kneeling to kiss her hand and ask her pardon for their momentary doubt
      of her, in the excitement and enthusiasm of their souls. But Lotys herself
      sat very silent,&mdash;almost as silent as Sergius Thord, who, though he
      drank the toast, remained moody and abstracted.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the company dispersed that night, each man present was carefully
      reminded by the secretary, Johan Zegota, that unless the most serious
      illness or misfortune intervened, every one must attend the next meeting,
      as it was the yearly "Day of Fate." Pasquin Leroy was told that his two
      friends, Max Graub and Axel Regor must be with him, and he willingly made
      himself surety for their attendance.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But," said he, as he gave the promise, "what is the Day of Fate?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Johan Zegota pointed a thin finger delicately at his heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Day of Fate," he said, "is the day of punishment,&mdash;or Decision
      of Deaths. The names of several persons who have been found guilty of
      treachery,&mdash;or who otherwise do injury to the people by the manner of
      their life and conduct, are written down on slips of paper, which are
      folded up and put in one receptacle, together with two or three hundred
      blanks. They must be all men's names,&mdash;we never make war on women.
      Against some of these names,&mdash;a Red Cross is placed. Whosoever draws
      a name, and finds the red cross against it, is bound to kill, within six
      months after due warning, the man therein mentioned. If he fortunately
      draws a blank then he is free for a year at least,&mdash;in spite of the
      fatal sign,&mdash;from the unpleasant duty of despatching a fellow mortal
      to the next world"&mdash;and here Zegota smiled quite cheerfully; "But if
      he draws a Name,&mdash;and at the same time sees the red cross against it,
      then he is bound by his oath to us to&mdash;<i>do his duty</i>!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Leroy nodded, and appeared in no wise dismayed at the ominous suggestion
      implied.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How if our friend Zouche were to draw the fatal sign," he said; "Would he
      perform his allotted task, think you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Most thoroughly!" replied Zegota, still smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      And with that, they separated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, during the constant change and interchange of conflicting
      rumours, some of which appeared to have foundation in fact, and others
      which rapidly dispersed themselves as fiction, there could be no doubt
      whatever of the growing unpopularity of the Government in power. Little by
      little, drop by drop, there oozed out the secrets of the "Pérousse
      Policy," which was merely another name for Pérousse Self-aggrandisement.
      Little by little, certain facts were at first whispered, and then more
      loudly talked about, as to the nature of his financial speculations; and
      it was soon openly stated that in the formation of some of the larger
      companies, which were beginning to be run on the Gargantuan lines of the
      "American Trust" idea, he had enormous shares,&mdash;though these "Trusts"
      had been frequently denounced as a means of enslaving the country, and
      ruining certain trade-interests which he was in office to protect.
      Accusations began to be guardedly thrown out against him in the Senate,
      which he parried off with the cool and audacious skill of an expert
      fencer, knowing that for the immediate moment at least, he had a
      "majority" under his thumb. This majority was composed of persons who had
      unfortunately become involved in his toils, and were, therefore, naturally
      afraid of him;&mdash;yet it was evident, even to a superficial student of
      events, that if once the innuendoes against his probity as a statesman
      could be veraciously proved, this sense of intimidation among his
      supporters would be removed, and like the props set against a decaying
      house, their withdrawal would result in the ruin of the building. It was
      pretty well known that the Marquis de Lutera had sent in his resignation,
      but it was not at all certain whether the King was of a mind to accept it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Things were in abeyance,&mdash;political and social matters whirled
      giddily towards chaos and confusion; and the numerous hurried Cabinet
      Councils that were convened, boded some perturbation among the governing
      heads of the State. From each and all of these meetings Ministers came
      away more gloomy and despondent in manner,&mdash;some shook their heads
      sorrowfully and spoke of "the King's folly,"&mdash;others with
      considerable indignation flung out sudden invectives against "the King's
      insolence!"&mdash;and between the two appellations, it was not easy to
      measure exactly the nature of the conduct which had deserved them. For the
      King himself made no alteration whatever in the outward character of his
      daily routine; he transacted business in the morning, lunched, sometimes
      with his family, sometimes with friends; drove in the afternoon, and
      showed himself punctiliously at different theatres once or twice in the
      evenings of the week. The only change more observant persons began to
      notice in his conduct was, that he had drawn the line of demarcation very
      strongly between those persons who by rank and worth, and nobility of
      life, merited his attention, and those who by mere Push and Pocket, sought
      to win his favour by that servile flattery and obsequiousness which are
      the trademarks of the plebeian and vulgarian. Quietly but firmly, he
      dropped the acquaintance of Jew sharks, lying in wait among the dirty
      pools of speculation;&mdash;with ease and absoluteness he 'let go' one by
      one, certain ladies of particularly elastic virtue, who fondly dreamed
      that they 'managed' him; and among these, to her infinite rage and
      despair, went Madame Vantine, wife of Vantine the winegrower, a
      yellow-haired, sensual "<i>femelle d'homme</i>," whose extravagance in
      clothes, and reckless indecency in conversation, combined with the King's
      amused notice, and the super-excellence of her husband's wines, had for a
      brief period made her 'the rage' among a certain set of exceedingly
      dissolute individuals.
    </p>
    <p>
      In place of this kind of riff-raff of "<i>nouveaux riches</i>," and
      plutocrats, he began by degrees to form around himself a totally different
      <i>entourage</i>,&mdash;though he was careful to make his various changes
      slowly, so that they should not be too freely noticed and commented upon.
      Great nobles, whether possessed of vast wealth and estates, or altogether
      landless, were summoned to take their rightful positions at the Court,
      where Vantine the wine-grower, and Jost the Jew, no more obtained
      admittance;&mdash;men of science, letters and learning, were sought out
      and honoured in various ways, their wives and daughters receiving special
      marks of the Royal attention and favour; and round the icy and statuesque
      beauty of the Queen soon gathered a brilliant bevy of the real world of
      women, not the half-world of the '<i>femme galante</i>' which having long
      held sway over the Crown Prince while Heir-Apparent to the Throne, judged
      itself almost as a necessary, and even becoming, appendage to his larger
      responsibility and state as King. These excellent changes, beneficial and
      elevating to the social atmosphere generally, could not of course be
      effected without considerable trouble and heart-burning, in the directions
      where certain persons had received their dismissal from such favour as
      they had previously held at Court. The dismissed ones thirsted with a
      desire for vengeance, and took every opportunity to inflame the passions
      of their own particular set against the King, some of them openly
      declaring their readiness to side with the Revolutionary party, and help
      it to power. But over the seething volcano of discontent, the tide of
      fashion moved as usual, to all outward appearances tranquil, and absorbed
      in trivialities of the latest description; and though many talked, few
      dreamed that the mind of the country, growing more compressed in thought,
      and inflammable in nature every day, was rapidly becoming like a huge
      magazine of gunpowder or dynamite, which at a spark would explode into
      that periodically recurring fire-of-cleansing called Revolution.
    </p>
    <p>
      Weighted with many thoughts, Sir Roger de Launay, whose taciturn and easy
      temperament disinclined him for argument and kept him aloof from
      discussion whenever he could avoid it, sat alone one evening in his own
      room which adjoined the King's library, writing a few special letters for
      his Majesty which were of too friendly a nature to be dealt with in the
      curt official manner of the private secretary. Once or twice he had risen
      and drawn aside the dividing curtain between himself and the King's
      apartment to see if his Royal master had entered; but the room remained
      empty, though it was long past eleven at night. He looked every now and
      again at a small clock which ticked with a quick intrusive cheerfulness on
      his desk,&mdash;then with a slight sigh resumed his work. Letter after
      letter was written and sealed, and he was getting to the end of his
      correspondence, when a tap at the door disturbed him, and his sister
      Teresa, the Queen's lady-in-waiting, entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is the King within?" she asked softly, moving almost on tiptoe as she
      came.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Roger shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He has been absent for some time," he replied,&mdash;then after a pause&mdash;"But
      what are you here for, Teresa? This is not your department!" and he took
      her hand kindly, noticing with some concern that there were tears in her
      large dark eyes;&mdash;"Is anything wrong?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing! That is,&mdash;nothing that I have any right to imagine&mdash;or
      to guess. But&mdash;" and here she seemed a little confused&mdash;"I am
      commanded by the Queen to summon you to her presence if,&mdash;if the King
      has not returned!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He rose at once, looking perplexed. Teresa watched him anxiously, and the
      expression of his face did not tend to reassure her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Roger," she began timidly&mdash;"Would you not tell me,&mdash;might I not
      know something of this mystery? Might I not be trusted?"
    </p>
    <p>
      His languid eyes flashed with a sudden tenderness, as from his great and
      stately height he looked down upon her pretty shrinking figure.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Poor little Teresa!" he murmured playfully; "What is the matter? What
      mystery are you talking about?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>You</i> know&mdash;you must know!" answered Teresa, clasping her hands
      with a gesture of entreaty; "There is something wrong, I am sure! Why is
      the King so often absent&mdash;when all the household suppose him to be
      with the Queen?&mdash;or in his private library there?" and she pointed to
      the curtained-off Royal sanctum beyond.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why does the Queen herself give it out that he is with her, when he is
      not? Why does he enter the Queen's corridor sometimes quite late at night
      by the private battlement-stair? Does it not seem very strange? And since
      he was so nearly assassinated, his absences have been more frequent than
      ever!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Roger pulled his long fair moustache meditatively between his fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      "When you were a little girl, Teresa, you must have been told the story of
      Blue-beard;" he said; "Now take my advice!&mdash;and do not try to open
      forbidden doors with your tiny golden key of curiosity!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Teresa's cheeks flushed a pretty rose pink.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am not curious;" she said, with an air of hauteur; "And indeed I am far
      too loyal to say anything to anyone but to you, of what seems so new and
      strange. Besides&mdash;the Queen has forbidden me&mdash;only it is just
      because of the Queen&mdash;" here she stopped hesitatingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because of the Queen?" echoed Sir Roger; "Why?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "She is unhappy!" said Teresa.
    </p>
    <p>
      A smile,&mdash;somewhat bitter,&mdash;crossed De Launay's face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Unhappy!" he repeated; "She! You mistake her, little girl! She does not
      know what it is to be unhappy; nothing so weak and slight as poor humanity
      affects the shining iceberg of her soul! For it <i>is</i> an iceberg,
      Teresa! The sun shines on it all day, fierce and hot, and never moves or
      melts one glittering particle!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He spoke with a concentrated passion of melancholy, and Teresa trembled a
      little. She knew, as no one else did, the intense and despairing love that
      had corroded her brother's life ever since the Queen had been brought home
      to the kingdom in all her exquisite maiden beauty, as bride of the
      Heir-Apparent. Such love terrified her; she did not understand it. She
      knew it was hopeless,&mdash;she felt it was disloyal,&mdash;and yet&mdash;it
      was love!&mdash;and her brother was one of the truest and noblest of
      gentlemen, devoted to the King's service, and incapable of a mean or a
      treacherous act. The position was quite incomprehensible to her, for she
      was not thoughtful enough to analyse it,&mdash;and she had no experience
      of the tender passion herself, to aid her in sympathetically considering
      its many moods, sorrows, and inexplicable martyrdoms of mind-torture. She
      contented herself now with repeating her former assertion.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She is unhappy,&mdash;I am sure she is! You may call her an iceberg, if
      you like, Roger!&mdash;men have such odd names for the women they are
      unable to understand! But I have seen the iceberg shed tears very often
      lately!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at her, surprised.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have? Then we may expect the Pallas Athene to weep in marble? Well!
      What did you say, Teresa? That her Majesty commanded my presence, if the
      King had not returned?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Teresa nodded assent. She was a little worried&mdash;her brother's face
      looked worn and pale, and he seemed moved beyond himself. She watched him
      nervously as he pushed aside the dividing curtain, and looked into the
      adjoining room. It was still vacant. The window stood open, and the line
      of the sea, glittering in the moon, shone far off like a string of jewels,&mdash;while
      the perfume of heliotrope and lilies came floating in deliciously on the
      cool night-breeze. Satisfied that there was as yet no sign of his Royal
      master, he turned back again,&mdash;and stooping his tall head, kissed the
      charming girl, whose anxious and timid looks betrayed her inward anxiety.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am ready, Teresa!" he said cheerfully; "Lead the way!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She glided quickly on before him, along an inner passage leading to the
      Queen's apartments. Arriving at one particular door, she opened it
      noiselessly, and with a warning finger laid on her lips, went in softly,&mdash;Sir
      Roger following. The light of rose-shaded waxen tapers which were
      reflected a dozen times in the silver-framed mirrors that rose up to the
      ceiling from banks of flowers below, shed a fairy-like radiance on the
      figure of the Queen, who, seated at a reading-table, with one hand buried
      in the loosened waves of her hair, seemed absorbed in the close study of a
      book. A straight white robe of thick creamy satin flowed round her perfect
      form,&mdash;it was slightly open at the throat, and softened with a
      drifting snow of lace, in which one or two great jewels sparkled. As Sir
      Roger approached her with his usual formal salute,&mdash;she turned
      swiftly round with an air of scarcely-concealed impatience.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where is the King?" she demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      Startled at the sudden peremptory manner of her question, Sir Roger
      hesitated,&mdash;for the moment taken quite aback.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did I not tell you," she went on, in the same imperious tone; "that I
      made you responsible for his safety? Yet&mdash;though you were by his side
      at the time&mdash;you could not shield him from attempted assassination!
      That was left,&mdash;to a woman!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Her breast heaved&mdash;her eyes flashed glorious lightning,&mdash;she
      looked altogether transformed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Had a thunder-bolt fallen through the painted ceiling at Sir Roger's feet,
      he could scarcely have been more astounded.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Madam!" he stammered,&mdash;and then as the light of her eyes swept over
      him, with a concentration of scorn and passion such as he had never seen
      in them, he grew deadly pale.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who, and what is this woman?" she went on; "Why was it given to <i>her</i>
      to save the King's life, while you stood by? Why was she brought to the
      Palace to be attended like some princess,&mdash;and then taken away
      secretly before I could see her? Lotys is her name&mdash;I know it by
      heart!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Like twinkling stars, the jewels in her lace scintillated with the quick
      panting of her breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The King is absent,"&mdash;she continued&mdash;"as usual;&mdash;but why
      are you not with him, also as usual? Answer me!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Madam," said De Launay, slowly; "For some few days past his Majesty has
      absolutely forbidden me to attend him. To carry out <i>your</i> commands I
      should be forced to disobey <i>his</i>!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him in a suppressed passion of enquiry.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then&mdash;is he alone?" she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Madam, I regret to say&mdash;he is quite alone!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She rose, and paced once up and down the room, a superb figure of mingled
      rage and pride, and humiliation, all comingled. Her eyes lighted on
      Teresa, who had timorously withdrawn to a corner of the apartment where
      she stood apparently busied in arranging some blossoms that had fallen too
      far out of the crystal vase in which they were set.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Teresa, you can leave us!" she said suddenly; "I will speak to Sir Roger
      alone."
    </p>
    <p>
      With a nervous glance at her brother, who stood mute, his head slightly
      bent, himself immovable as a figure of stone, Teresa curtseyed and
      withdrew.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Queen stood haughtily erect,&mdash;her white robes trailing around
      her,&mdash;her exquisite face transfigured into a far grander beauty than
      had ever been seen upon it, by some pent-up emotion which to Sir Roger was
      well-nigh inexplicable. His heart beat thickly; he could almost hear its
      heavy pulsations, and he kept his eyes lowered, lest she should read too
      clearly in them the adoration of a lifetime.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sir Roger, speak plainly," she said, "and speak the truth! Some little
      time ago you said it was wrong for me to shut out from my sight, my heart,
      my soul, the ugly side of Nature. I have remedied that fault! I am looking
      at the ugly side of Nature now,&mdash;in myself! The rebellious side&mdash;the
      passionate, fierce, betrayed side! I trusted you with the safety of the
      King!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Madam, he <i>is</i> safe!" said Sir Roger quietly;&mdash;"I can guarantee
      upon my life that he is with those who will defend him far more thoroughly
      than I could ever do! It is better to have a hundred protectors than one!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I know what you would imply!" she answered, impatiently; "I
      understand, thus far, from what he himself has told me. But&mdash;there is
      something else, something else! Something that portends far closer and
      more intimate danger to him&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      She paused, apparently uncertain how to go on, and moving back to her
      chair, sat down.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you are the man I have imagined you to be," she continued, in
      deliberate accents; "You perfectly know&mdash;you perfectly understand
      what I mean!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Roger raised his head and looked her bravely in the eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You would imply, Madam, that one, who like myself has been conscious of a
      great passion for many years, should be able to recognise the signs of it
      in others! Your Majesty is right! Once you expressed to me a wonder as to
      what it was like 'to feel.' If that experience has come to you now, I
      cannot but rejoice,&mdash;even while I grieve to think that you must
      endure pain at the discovery. Yet it is only from the pierced earth that
      the flowers can bloom,&mdash;and it may be you will have more mercy for
      others, when you yourself are wounded!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She was silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      He drew a step nearer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You wish me to speak plainly?" he continued in a lower tone. "You give me
      leave to express the lurking thought which is in your own heart?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She gave a slight inclination of her head, and he went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You assume danger for the King,&mdash;but not danger from the knife of
      the assassin&mdash;or from the schemes of revolutionists! You judge him&mdash;as
      I do&mdash;to be in the grasp of the greatest Force which exists in the
      universe! The force against which there is, and can be no opposition!&mdash;a
      force, which if it once binds even a king&mdash;makes of him a
      life-prisoner, and turns mere 'temporal power' to nothingness; upsetting
      thrones, destroying kingdoms, and beating down the very Church itself in
      the way of its desires&mdash;and that force is&mdash;Love!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She started violently,&mdash;then controlled herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You waste your eloquence!" she said coldly; "What you speak of, I do not
      understand. I do not believe in Love!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Or jealousy?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The words sprang from his lips almost unconsciously, and like a
      magnificent animal who has been suddenly stung, she sprang upright.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How dare you!" she said in low, vibrating accents&mdash;"How dare you!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Roger's breath came quick and fast,&mdash;but he was a strong man with
      a strong will, and he maintained his attitude of quiet resolution.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Madam!&mdash;My Queen!&mdash;forgive me!" he said; "But as your humblest
      friend&mdash;your faithful servant!&mdash;let me have my say with you now&mdash;and
      then&mdash;if you will&mdash;condemn me to perpetual silence! You despise
      Love, you say! Yes&mdash;because you have only seen its poor imitations!
      The King's light gallantries,&mdash;his sins of body, which in many cases
      are not sins of mind, have disgusted you with its very name! The King has
      loved&mdash;or can love&mdash;so you think,&mdash;many, or any, women! Ah!
      No&mdash;no! Pardon me, dearest Majesty! A man's desire may lead him
      through devious ways both vile and vicious,&mdash;but a man's <i>love</i>
      leads only one way to one woman! Believe it! For even so, I have loved one
      woman these many years!&mdash;and even so&mdash;I greatly fear&mdash;the
      King loves one woman now!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Rigid as a figure of marble, she looked at him. He met her eyes calmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your Majesty asked me for the truth;" he said; "I have spoken it!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Her lips parted in a cold, strained little smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And&mdash;you&mdash;think," she said slowly; "that I&mdash;I am what you
      call 'jealous' of this 'one woman'? Had jealousy been in my nature, it
      would have been provoked sufficiently often since my marriage!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Madam," responded Sir Roger humbly; "If I may dare to say so to your
      Majesty, it is not possible to a noble woman to be jealous of a man's mere
      humours of desire! But of Love&mdash;Love, the crown, the glory and
      supremacy of life,&mdash;who, with a human heart and human blood, would
      not be jealous? Who would not give kingdoms, thrones, ay, Heaven itself,
      if it were not in itself Heaven, for its rapturous oblivion of sorrow, and
      its full measure of joy!"
    </p>
    <p>
      A dead silence fell between them, only disturbed by a small silver chime
      in the distance, striking midnight.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Queen again seated herself, and drew her book towards her. Then
      raising her lovely unfathomable eyes, she looked at the tall stately
      figure of the man before her with a slight touch of pity and pathos.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Possibly you may be right," she said slowly, "Possibly wrong! But I do
      not doubt that you yourself personally 'feel' all that you express,&mdash;and&mdash;that
      you are faithful!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Here she extended her hand. Sir Roger bowed low over it, and kissed its
      delicate smoothness with careful coldness. As she withdrew it again, she
      said in a low dreamy, half questioning tone:
    </p>
    <p>
      "The woman's name is Lotys?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Silently Sir Roger bent his head in assent.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A man's love leads only one way&mdash;to one woman! And in this
      particular case that woman is&mdash;Lotys!" she said, with a little musing
      scorn, as of herself,&mdash;"Strange!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She laid her hand on the bell which at a touch would summon back her
      lady-in-waiting. "You have served me well, Sir Roger, albeit somewhat
      roughly&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      He gave a low exclamation of regret.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Roughly, Madam?"
    </p>
    <p>
      A smile, sudden and sweet, which transfigured her usually passionless
      features into an almost angelic loveliness, lit up her mouth and eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes&mdash;roughly! But no matter! I pardon you freely! Good-night!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good-night to your Majesty!" And as he stepped backward from her
      presence, she rang for Teresa, who at once entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Our excommunication from the Church sits lightly upon us, Sir Roger, does
      it not?" said the Queen then, almost playfully; "You must know that we say
      our prayers as of old, and we still believe God hears us!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Surely, Madam," he replied, "God must hear all prayers when they are pure
      and honest!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Truly, I think so," she responded, laying one hand tenderly on Teresa's
      hair, as the girl caressingly knelt beside her. "And&mdash;so, despite
      lack of priestcraft,&mdash;we shall continue to pray,&mdash;in these
      uncertain and dangerous times,&mdash;that all may be well for the country,&mdash;the
      people, and&mdash;the King! Good-night!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Again Sir Roger bowed, and this time altogether withdrew. He was strung up
      to a pitch of intense excitement; the brief interview had been a most
      trying one for him,&mdash;though there was a warm glow at his heart,
      assuring him that he had done well. His suspicion that the King had
      admired, and had sought out Lotys since the day she saved him from
      assassination, had a very strong foundation in fact;&mdash;much stronger
      indeed than was at present requisite to admit or to declare. But the whole
      matter was a source of the greatest anxiety to De Launay, who, in his
      strong love for his Royal master, found it often difficult to conceal his
      apprehension,&mdash;and who was in a large measure relieved to feel that
      the Queen had guessed something of it, and shared in his sentiments. He
      now re-entered his room, and on doing so at once perceived that the King
      had returned. But his Majesty was busy writing, and did not raise his head
      from his papers, even when Sir Roger noiselessly entered and laid some
      letters on the table. His complete abstraction in his work was a sign that
      he did not wish to be disturbed or spoken to;&mdash;and Sir Roger, taking
      the hint, retired again in silence.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXVII. &mdash; THE SONG OF FREEDOM
    </h2>
    <p>
      Revolution! The flame-winged Fury that swoops down on a people like a
      sudden visitation of God, with the movement of a storm, and the
      devastation of a plague in one! Who shall say how, or where, the seed is
      sown that springs so swiftly to such thick harvest! Who can trace its
      beginnings&mdash;and who can predict its end! Tragic and terrible as its
      work has always seemed to the miserable and muddle-headed human units,
      whose faults and follies, whose dissoluteness and neglect of the highest
      interests of the people, are chiefly to blame for the birth of this
      Monster, it is nevertheless Divine Law, that, when any part of God's
      Universe-House is deliberately made foul by the dwellers in it, then must
      it be cleansed,&mdash;and Revolution is the burning of the rubbish,&mdash;the
      huge bonfire in which old abuses blazon their destruction to an amazed and
      terror-stricken world. Yet there have been moments, or periods, in
      history, when the threatening conflagration could have been stayed and
      turned back from its course,&mdash;when the useless shedding of blood
      might have been foregone&mdash;when the fierce passions of the people
      might have been soothed and pacified, and when Justice might have been
      nobly done and catastrophe averted, if there had been but one brave man,&mdash;one
      only!&mdash;and that man a King! But in nearly all the convulsive throes
      of nations, kings have proved themselves the weakest, tamest, most
      cowardly and ineffectual of all the heads of the time&mdash;ready and
      willing enough to sacrifice the lives of thousands of brave and devoted
      men to their own cause, but never prepared to sacrifice themselves. Hence
      the cause of the triumph of Democracy over effete Autocracy. Kings may not
      be more than men,&mdash;but, certes, they should never be less. They
      should not practise vices of which the very day-labourer whom they employ,
      would be ashamed; nor should they flaunt their love of sensuality and
      intrigue in the faces of their subjects as a 'Royal example' and
      distinctive 'lead' to vulgar licentiousness. The loftier the position, the
      greater the responsibility;&mdash;and a monarch who voluntarily lowers the
      social standard in his realm has lost more adherents than could possibly
      be slain in his defence on the field of honour.
    </p>
    <p>
      The King who plays his part as the hero of this narrative, was now fully
      aware in his own mind and conscience of the thousands of opportunities he
      had missed and wasted on his way to the Throne when Heir-Apparent. Since
      the day of his 'real coronation,' when as he had expressed it to his
      thoughts, he had 'crowned himself with his own resolve,' he had studied
      men, manners, persons and events, to deep and serious purpose. He had
      learned much, and discovered more. He had been, in a moral sense,
      conquered by his son, Prince Humphry, who had proved a match for him in
      his determined and honourable marriage for love, and love only,&mdash;though
      born heir to all the conventions and hypocrisies of a Throne. He,&mdash;in
      his day,&mdash;had lacked the courage and truth that this boy had shown.
      And now, by certain means known best to himself, he had fathomed an
      intricate network of deception and infamy among the governing heads of the
      State. He had convinced himself in many ways of the unblushing dishonesty
      and fraudulent self-service of Carl Pérousse. And&mdash;yet&mdash;with all
      this information stored carefully up in his brain he, to all appearances,
      took no advantage of it, and did nothing remarkable,&mdash;save the one
      act which had been so much talked about&mdash;the refusal of land in his
      possession to the Jesuits for a 'religious' (and political) settlement.
      This independent course of procedure had resulted in his excommunication
      from the Church. Of his 'veto' against an intended war, scarcely anything
      was known. Only the Government were aware of the part he had taken in that
      matter,&mdash;the Government and&mdash;the Money-market! But the time was
      now ripe for further movement; and in the deep and almost passionate
      interest he had recently learned to take in the affairs of the actual
      People, he was in no humour for hesitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had mapped out in his brain a certain plan of action, and he was
      determined to go through with it. The more so, as now a new and close
      interest had incorporated itself with his life,&mdash;an emotion so deep
      and tender and overwhelming, that he scarcely dared to own it to himself,&mdash;scarcely
      ventured to believe that he, deprived of true love so long, should now be
      truly loved for himself, at last! But on this he seldom allowed his mind
      to dwell,&mdash;except when quite alone,&mdash;in the deep silences of
      night;&mdash;when he gave his soul up to the secret sweetness which had
      begun to purify and ennoble his innermost nature,&mdash;when he saw
      visioned before him a face,&mdash;warm with the passion of a love so grand
      and unselfish that it drew near to a likeness of the Divine;&mdash;a love
      that asked nothing, and gave everything, with the beneficent glory of the
      sunlight bestowing splendour on the earth. His lonely moments, which were
      few, were all the time he devoted to this brooding luxury of meditation,
      and though his heart beat like a boy's, and his eyes grew dim with
      tenderness, as in fancy he dreamed of joy that might be, and that yet
      still more surely might never be his,&mdash;his determined mind, braced
      and bent to action, never faltered for a second in the new conceptions he
      had formed of his duty to his people, who, as he now considered, had been
      too long and too cruelly deceived.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hence, something like an earthquake shock sent its tremor through the
      country, when two things were suddenly announced without warning, as the
      apparent results of the various Cabinet Councils held latterly so often,
      and in such haste. The first was, that not only had his Majesty accepted
      the resignation of the Marquis de Lutera as Premier, but that he had
      decided&mdash;provided the selection was entirely agreeable to the
      Government&mdash;to ask M. Carl Pérousse to form a Ministry in his place.
      The second piece of intelligence, and one that was received with much more
      favour than the first, by all classes and conditions of persons, was that
      the Government had issued a decree for the complete expulsion of the
      Jesuits from the country. By a certain named date, and within a month,
      every Jesuit must have left the King's dominions, or else must take the
      risk of a year's imprisonment followed by compulsory banishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Much uproar and discussion did this mandate excite among the clerical
      parties of Europe,&mdash;much indignation did it breed within that Holy of
      Holies situate at the Vatican,&mdash;which, having launched forth the ban
      of excommunication, had no further thunderbolts left to throw at the head
      of the recreant and abandoned Royalty whose 'temporal power' so insolently
      superseded the spiritual. But the country breathed freely; relieved from a
      dangerous and mischievous incubus. The educational authorities gave
      fervent thanks to Heaven for sparing them from long dreaded interference;&mdash;and
      when it was known that the excommunicated King was the chief mover in this
      firm and liberating act, a silent wave of passionate gratitude and
      approval ran through the multitudes of the people, who would almost have
      assembled under the Palace walls and offered a grand demonstration to
      their monarch, who had so boldly carried the war into the enemy's country
      and won the victory, had they not been held back and checked from their
      purpose by the counter-feeling of their disgust at his Majesty's
      apparently forthcoming choice of Carl Pérousse as Prime Minister.
    </p>
    <p>
      Swayed this way and that, the people were divided more absolutely than
      before into those two sections which always become very dangerous when
      strongly marked out as distinctly separated,&mdash;the Classes and the
      Masses. The comfortable wedge of Trade, which,&mdash;calling itself the
      Middle-class,&mdash;had up to the present kept things firm, now split
      asunder likewise,&mdash;the wealthy plutocrats clinging willy-nilly to the
      Classes, to whom they did not legitimately belong; and the men of moderate
      income throwing in their lot with the Masses, whose wrongs they
      sympathetically felt somewhat resembled their own. For taxation had ground
      them down to that particularly fine powder, which when applied to the
      rocks of convention and usage, proves to be of a somewhat blasting
      quality. They had paid as much on their earnings and their goods as they
      could or would pay;&mdash;more indeed than they had any reasonable right
      to pay,&mdash;and being sick of Government mismanagement, and also of what
      they still regarded as the King's indifference to their needs, they were
      prepared to make a dash for liberty. The expulsion of the Jesuits they
      naturally looked upon as a suitable retaliation on Rome for the
      excommunication of the Royal Family; but beyond the intense relief it gave
      to all, it could not be considered as affecting or materially altering the
      political situation. So, like the dividing waves of the Red Sea, which
      rolled up on either side to permit the passage of Moses and his followers&mdash;the
      Classes and the Masses piled themselves up in opposite billowy sections to
      allow Sergius Thord and the Revolutionary party to pass triumphantly
      through their midst, adding thousands of adherents to their forces from
      both sides;&mdash;while they were prepared to let the full weight of the
      billows engulf the King, if, like Pharaoh and his chariots, he assumed too
      much, or proceeded too far.
    </p>
    <p>
      Professor von Glauben, seated in his own sanctum, and engaged in the
      continuance of his "Political History of Hunger," found many points in the
      immediate situation which considerably interested him and moved him to
      philosophical meditation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "For,&mdash;take the feeling of the People as it now is," he said to
      himself; "It starts in Hunger! The taxes,&mdash;the uncomfortable visit of
      the tax-gatherer! The price of the loaf,&mdash;concerning which the baker,
      or the baker-ess, politely tells the customer that it is costly, because
      of the Government tax on corn; then from the bread, it is marvellous how
      the little clue winds upward through the spider-webs of Trade. The
      butcher's meat is dearer,&mdash;for says he&mdash;'The tax on corn makes
      it necessary for me to increase the price of meat.' There is no logical
      reason given,&mdash;the fact simply <i>is</i>! So that Hunger commences
      the warfare,&mdash;Hunger of Soul, as well as Hunger of body. 'Why starve
      my thought?' says Soul. 'Why tax my bread?' says Body. These tiresome
      questions continue to be asked, and never answered,&mdash;but answers are
      clamoured for, and the people complain&mdash;and then one fierce day the
      gods hear them grumble, and begin to grumble back! Ach! Then it is thunder
      with a vengeance! Now in my own so-beloved Fatherland, there has been this
      double grumbling for a long time. And that the storm will burst, in spite
      of the so-excellently-advertising Kaiser is evident! Hoch!&mdash;or <i>Ach</i>?
      Which should it be to salute the Kaiser! I know not at all,&mdash;but I
      admit it is clever of him to put up a special Hoarding-announcement for
      the private view of the Almighty God, each time he addresses his troops!
      And he will come in for a chapter of my history&mdash;for he also is
      Hungry!&mdash;he would fain eat a little of the loaf of Britain!&mdash;yes!&mdash;he
      will fit into my work very well for the instruction of the helpless unborn
      generations!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He wrote on for a while, and then laid down his pen. His eyes grew dreamy,
      and his rough features softened.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What has become of the child, I wonder!" he mused; "Where has she gone,
      the 'Glory-of-the-Sea'! I would give all I have to look upon her beautiful
      face again;&mdash;and Ronsard&mdash;he, poor soul&mdash;silent as a stone,
      weakening day after day in the grasp of relentless age,&mdash;would die
      happy,&mdash;if I would let him! But I do not intend to give him that
      satisfaction. He shall live! As I often tell him, my science is of no
      avail if I cannot keep a man going, till at least a hundred and odd years
      are past. Barring accidents, or self-slaughter, of course!" Here he became
      somewhat abstracted in his meditations. "The old fellow is brave enough,&mdash;brave
      as a lion, and strong too for his years;&mdash;I have seen him handle a
      pair of oars and take down a sail as I could never do it,&mdash;and&mdash;he
      has accepted a strange and difficult situation heroically. 'You must not
      be involved in any trouble by a knowledge of our movements.' So Prince
      Humphry said, when I saw him last,&mdash;though I did not then understand
      the real drift of his meaning. And time goes on&mdash;and time seems
      wearisome without any tidings of those we love!"
    </p>
    <p>
      A tap at the door disturbed his mental soliloquy, and in answer to his
      'Come in,' Sir Roger de Launay entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sorry to interrupt work, Professor!" he said briefly; "The King goes to
      the Opera this evening, and desires you to be of the party."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good! I shall obey with more pleasure than I have obeyed some of his
      Majesty's recent instructions!" And the Professor pushed aside his
      manuscript to look through his spectacled eyes at the tall equerry's
      handsome face and figure. "You have a healthy appearance, Roger! Your
      complexion speaks of an admirable digestion!"
    </p>
    <p>
      De Launay smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You think so? Well! Your professional approval is worth having!" He
      paused, then went on; "The party will be a pleasant one to-night. The King
      is in high spirits."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah!" And Von Glauben's monosyllable spoke volumes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps he ought not to be?" suggested Sir Roger with a slight touch of
      anxiety.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do not know&mdash;I cannot tell! This is the way of it, Roger&mdash;see!"
      And taking off his spectacles, he polished them with due solemnity. "If I
      were a King, and ruled over a country swarming with dissatisfied subjects,&mdash;if
      I had a fox for a Premier,&mdash;and was in love with a woman who could
      not possibly be my wife,&mdash;I should not be in high spirits!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nor I!" said De Launay curtly. "But the fox is not Premier yet. Do you
      think he ever will be?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Von Glauben shrugged his shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He is bound to be, I presume. What else remains to do? Upset everything?
      Government, deputies and all?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just that!" responded Sir Roger. "The People will do it, if the King does
      not."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The King will do anything he is asked to do&mdash;now&mdash;" said the
      Professor significantly; "If the right person asks him!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You forget&mdash;she does not know&mdash;" Here checking himself
      abruptly, Sir Roger walked to the window and looked out. It was a fair and
      peaceful afternoon,&mdash;the ocean heaved placidly, covered with
      innumerable wavelets, over which the seabirds flew and darted, their wings
      shining like silver and diamonds as they dipped and circled up and down
      and round the edges of the rocky coast. Far off, a faint rim of amethyst
      under a slowly sailing white cloud could be recognized as the first line
      of the shore of The Islands.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you ever go and see the beautiful 'Gloria' girl now?" asked Sir Roger
      suddenly. "The King has never mentioned her since the day we saw her. And
      you have never explained the mystery of your acquaintance with her,&mdash;nor
      whether it is true that Prince Humphry was specially attracted by her. I
      shrewdly suspect&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That he has been sent off, out of harm's way!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are right," said the Professor gravely; "That is exactly the
      position! He has been sent off out of harm's way!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I heard," went on De Launay, "that the girl&mdash;or some girl of
      remarkable beauty had been seen here&mdash;actually here in the Palace&mdash;before
      the Prince left! And such an odd way he left, too&mdash;scuttling off in
      his own yacht without&mdash;so far as I have ever heard&mdash;any
      farewells, or preparation, or suitable companions to go with him. Still
      one hears such extraordinary stories&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "True!&mdash;one does!" agreed the Professor; "And after proper
      experience, one hears without listening!"
    </p>
    <p>
      De Launay looked at him curiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The girl was certainly beautiful," he proceeded meditatively; "And her
      adopted father,&mdash;Réné Ronsard,&mdash;was not that his name?&mdash;was
      a quaint old fellow. A republican, too!&mdash;fiery as a new Danton! Well!
      The King's curiosity is apparently satisfied on that score,&mdash;but"&mdash;here
      he began to laugh&mdash;"I shall never forget your face, Von Glauben, when
      he caught you on The Islands that day!&mdash;never! Like an overgrown boy,
      discovered with his fingers in a jam-pot!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you!" said the Professor imperturbably; "I can assure you that the
      jam was excellent&mdash;and that I still remember its flavour!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Roger laughed again, but with great good-humour,&mdash;then he became
      suddenly serious.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The King goes out alone very often now?" he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very often," assented the Professor.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are we right in allowing him to do so?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Allowing him! Who is to forbid him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is he safe, do you think?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Safer, it would seem, my friend, than when laying a foundation-stone,
      with ourselves and all his suite around him!" responded the Professor.
      "Besides, it is too late now to count the possible risks of the adventure
      he has entered upon. He knows the position, and estimates the cost at its
      correct value. He has made himself the ruler of his own destiny; we are
      only his servants. Personally, I have no fear,&mdash;save of one
      fatality."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is what kills many strong men off in their middle-age," said Von Glauben;
      "A disease for which there is no possible cure at that special time of
      life,&mdash;Love! The love of boys is like a taste for green gooseberries,&mdash;it
      soon passes, leaving a disordered stomach and a general disrelish for acid
      fruit ever afterwards;&mdash;the love of the man-about-town between the
      twenties and thirties is the love of self;&mdash;but the love of a Man,
      after the Self-and-Clothes Period has passed, is the love of the
      full-grown human creature clamouring for its mate,&mdash;its mate in Soul
      even more than in Body. There is no gainsaying it&mdash;no checking it&mdash;no
      pacifying it; it is a most disastrous business, provocative of all manner
      of evils,&mdash;and to a king who has always been accustomed to have his
      own way, it means Victory or Death!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Roger gazed at him perplexedly,&mdash;his tone was so solemn and full
      of earnest meaning.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You, for example," continued the Professor dictatorially, fixing his keen
      piercing eyes full upon him; "You are a curious subject,&mdash;a very
      curious subject! You live on a Dream; it is a good life&mdash;an excellent
      life! It has the advantage, your Dream, of never becoming a reality,&mdash;therefore
      you will always love,&mdash;and while you always love, you will always
      keep young. Your lot is an exceedingly enviable one, my friend! You need
      not frown,&mdash;I am old enough&mdash;and let us hope wise enough&mdash;to
      guess your secret&mdash;to admire it from a purely philosophic point of
      view&mdash;and to respect it!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Roger held his peace.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But," continued the Professor, "His Majesty is not the manner of man who
      would consent to subsist, like you, on an idle phantasy. If he loves&mdash;he
      must possess; it is the regal way!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He will never succeed in the direction <i>you</i> mean!" said Sir Roger
      emphatically.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never!" agreed Von Glauben with a profound shake of his head; "Strange as
      it may seem, his case is quite as hopeless as yours!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The door opened and closed abruptly,&mdash;and there followed silence. Von
      Glauben looked up to find himself alone. He smiled tolerantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Poor Roger!" he murmured; "He lives the life of a martyr by choice! Some
      men do&mdash;and like it! They need not do it;&mdash;there is not the
      least necessity in the world for their deliberately sticking a knife into
      their hearts and walking about with it in a kind of idiot rapture. It must
      hurt;&mdash;but they seem to enjoy it! Just as some women become nuns, and
      flagellate themselves,&mdash;and then when they are writhing from their
      own self-inflicted stripes, they dream they are the 'brides of Christ,'
      entirely forgetting the extremely irreligious fact that to have so many
      'brides' the good Christ Himself might possibly be troubled, and would
      surely occupy an inconvenient position, even in Heaven! Each man,&mdash;each
      woman,&mdash;makes for himself or herself a little groove or pet sorrow,
      in which to trot round and round and bemoan life; the secret of the whole
      bemoaning being that he or she cannot have precisely the thing he or she
      wants. That is all! Such a trifle! Church, State, Prayer and Power&mdash;it
      can all be summed up in one line&mdash;'I have not the thing I want&mdash;give
      it to me!'"
    </p>
    <p>
      He resumed his writing, and did not interrupt it again till it was time to
      join the Royal party at the Opera.
    </p>
    <p>
      That evening was one destined to be long remembered in the annals of the
      kingdom. The beautiful Opera-house, a marvel of art and architecture, was
      brilliantly full; all the fairest women and most distinguished men
      occupying the boxes and stalls, while round and round, in a seemingly
      never-ending galaxy of faces, and crowded in the tiers of balconies above,
      a mixed audience had gathered, made up of various sections of the populace
      which filled the space well up to the furthest galleries. The attraction
      that had drawn so large an audience together was not contained in the
      magnetic personality of either the King or Queen, for those exalted
      individuals had only announced their intention of being present just two
      hours before the curtain rose. Moreover, when their Majesties entered the
      Royal box, accompanied by their two younger sons, Rupert and Cyprian, and
      attended by their personal suite, their appearance created very little
      sensation. The fact that it was the first time the King had showed himself
      openly in public since his excommunication from the Church, caused perhaps
      a couple of hundred persons to raise their eyes inquisitively towards him
      in a kind of half-morbid, half-languid curiosity, but in these days the
      sentiment of Self is so strong, that it is only a minority of more
      thoughtful individuals that ever trouble themselves seriously to consider
      the annoyances or griefs which their fellow-mortals have to endure, often
      alone and undefended.
    </p>
    <p>
      The interest of the public on this particular occasion was centred in the
      new Opera, which had only been given three times before, and in which the
      little dancer, Pequita, played the part of a child-heroine. The <i>libretto</i>
      was the work of Paul Zouche, and the music by one of the greatest
      violinists in the world, Louis Valdor. The plot was slight enough;&mdash;yet,
      described in exquisite verse, and scattered throughout with the daintiest
      songs and dances, it merited a considerably higher place in musical
      records than such works as Meyerbeer's "Dinorah," or Verdi's "Rigoletto."
      The thread on which the pearls of poesy and harmony were strung, was the
      story of a wandering fiddler, who, accompanied by his only child (the part
      played by Pequita), travels from city to city earning a scant livelihood
      by his own playing and his daughter's dancing. Chance or fate leads them
      to throw in their fortunes with a band of enthusiastic adventurers, who,
      headed by a young hare-brained patriot, elected as their leader, have
      determined to storm the Vatican, and demand the person of the Pope, that
      they may convey him to America, there to convene an assemblage of all true
      Christians (or 'New Christians'), and found a new and more Christ-like
      Church. Their expedition fails,&mdash;as naturally so wild a scheme would
      be bound to do,&mdash;but though they cannot succeed in capturing the
      Pope, they secure a large following of the Italian populace, who join with
      them in singing "The Song of Freedom," which, with Paul Zouche's words,
      and Valdor's music was the great <i>chef d'oevre</i> of the Opera, rousing
      the listeners to a pitch of something like frenzy. In this,&mdash;the last
      great scene,&mdash;Pequita, dancing the 'Dagger Dance,' is supposed to
      infect the people with that fervour which moves them to sing "The Freedom
      Chorus," and the curtain comes down upon a brilliant stage, crowded with
      enthusiasts and patriots, ready to fight and die for the glory of their
      country. A love-interest is given to the piece by the passion of the
      wandering fiddler-hero for a girl whose wealth places her above his reach;
      and who in the end sacrifices all worldly advantage that she may share his
      uncertain fortunes for love's sake only.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such was the story,&mdash;which, wedded to wild and passionate music, had
      taken the public by storm on its first representation, not only on account
      of its own merit, but because it gave their new favourite, Pequita, many
      opportunities for showing off her exquisite grace as a dancer. She, while
      preparing for the stage on this special night, had been told that her wish
      was about to be granted&mdash;that she would now, at last, really dance
      before the King;&mdash;and her heart beat high, and the rich colour
      reddened in her soft childish face, as she donned her scarlet skirts with
      more than her usual care, and knotted back her raven curls with a great
      glowing damask rose, such as Spanish beauties fasten behind tiny
      shell-like ears to emphasise the perfection of their contour. Her thoughts
      flew to her kindest friend, Pasquin Leroy;&mdash;she remembered the starry
      diamond in the ring he had wished to give her, and how he had said,
      'Pequita, the first time you dance before the King, this shall be yours!'
    </p>
    <p>
      Where was he now, she wondered? She would have given anything to know his
      place of abode, just to send him word that the King was to be at the Opera
      that night, and ask him too, to come and see her in her triumph! But she
      had no time to study ways and means for sending a message to him, either
      through Sholto, her father, who always waited patiently for her behind the
      scenes,&mdash;or through Paul Zouche, who, though as <i>librettist</i> of
      the opera, and as a poet of new and rising fame, was treated by everyone
      with the greatest deference, still made a special point of appearing in
      the shabbiest clothes, and lounging near the side-wings like a sort of
      disgraced tramp all the time the performance was in progress. Neither of
      them knew Leroy's address;&mdash;they only met him or saw him, when he
      himself chose to come among them. Besides,&mdash;the sound of the National
      Hymn played by the orchestra, warned her that the King had arrived; and
      that she must hold herself in readiness for her part and think of nothing
      else.
    </p>
    <p>
      The blaze of light in the Opera-house seemed more dazzling than usual to
      the child, when her cue was called,&mdash;and as she sprang from the wings
      and bounded towards the footlights, amid the loud roar of applause which
      she was now accustomed to receive nightly, she raised her eyes towards the
      Royal box, half-frightened, half-expectant. Her heart sank as she saw that
      the King had partially turned away from the stage, and was chatting
      carelessly with some person or persons behind him, and that only a
      statuesque woman with a pale face, great eyes, and a crown of diamonds,
      regarded her steadily with a high-bred air of chill indifference, which
      was sufficient to turn the little warm beating heart of her into stone. A
      handsome youth stared down upon her smiling,&mdash;his eyes sleepily
      amorous,&mdash;it was the elder of the King's two younger sons, Prince
      Rupert. She hated his expression, beautiful though his features were,&mdash;and
      hated herself for having to dance before him. Poor little Pequita! It was
      her first experience of the insult a girl-child can be made to feel
      through the look of a budding young profligate. On and on she danced,
      giddily whirling;&mdash;the thoughts in her brain circling as rapidly as
      her movements. Why would not the King look at her,&mdash;she thought? Why
      was he so indifferent, even when his subjects sought most to please him?
      At the end of the second act of the Opera a great fatigue and lassitude
      overcame her, and a look of black resentment clouded her pretty face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What ails you?" said Zouche, sauntering up to her as she stood behind the
      wings; "You look like a small thunder-cloud!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She gave an unmistakable gesture in the direction of that quarter of the
      theatre where the Royal box was situated.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hate him!" she said, with a stamp of her little foot.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The King? So do I!" And Zouche lit a cigarette and stuck it between his
      lips by way of a stop-gap to a threatening violent expletive; "An
      insolent, pampered, flattered fool! Yet you wanted to dance before him;
      and now you've done it! The fact will serve you as a kind of
      advertisement! That is all!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do not want to be advertised through <i>his</i> favour!" And Pequita
      closed her tiny teeth on her scarlet under-lip in suppressed anger; "But I
      have not danced before him yet! I <i>will</i>!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Zouche looked at her sleepily. He was not drunk&mdash;though he had,&mdash;of
      course,&mdash;been drinking.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have not danced before him? Then what have you been doing?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Walking!" answered Pequita, with a fierce little laugh, her colour coming
      and going with all the quick wavering hue of irritated and irritable
      Spanish blood, "I have, as they say 'walked across the stage.' I shall
      dance presently!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He smiled, flicking a little ash off his cigarette.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are a curious child!" he said; "By and by you will want severely
      keeping in order!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Pequita laughed again, and shook back her long curls defiantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who is that cold woman with a face like a mask and the crown of diamonds,
      that sits beside the King?"
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Zouche's turn to laugh now, and he did so with a keen sense of
      enjoyment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Upon my word!" he exclaimed; "A little experience of the world has given
      you what newspaper men call 'local colour.' The 'cold woman with the face
      like a mask,' is the Queen!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Pequita made a little grimace of scorn.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And who is the leering boy?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Prince Rupert."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Crown Prince?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No. The Crown Prince is travelling abroad. He went away very
      mysteriously,&mdash;no one knows where he has gone, or when he will come
      back."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am not surprised!" said Pequita; "With such a father and mother, and
      such impudent-looking brothers, no wonder he wanted to get away!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Zouche had another fit of laughter. He had never seen the little girl in
      such a temper. He tried to assume gravity.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pequita, you are naughty! The flatteries of the great world are spoiling
      you!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bah!" said Pequita, with a contemptuous wave of her small brown hands.
      "The flatteries of the great world! To what do they lead? To <i>that</i>!"
      and she made another eloquent sign towards the Royal box;&mdash;"I would
      rather dance for you and Lotys, and Sergius Thord, and Pasquin Leroy, than
      all the Kings of the world together! What I do here is for my father's
      sake&mdash;<i>you</i> know that!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know!" and Zouche smoked on, and shook his wild head sentimentally,&mdash;murmuring
      in a <i>sotto-voce</i>:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  "What I do <i>here</i>, is for the need of gold,&mdash;
    What I do <i>there</i>, is for sweet love's sake only;
  Love, ever timid <i>there</i>, doth <i>here</i> grow bold,&mdash;
    And wins such triumph as but leaves me lonely!"
</pre>
    <p>
      "Is that yours?" said Pequita with a sudden smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mine, or Shakespeare's," answered Zouche indolently; "Does it matter
      which?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Pequita laughed, and her cue being just then called, again she bounded on
      to the stage; but this time she played her part, as the stock phrase goes,
      'to the gallery,' and did not once turn her eyes towards the place where
      the King sat withdrawn into the shadow of his box, giving no sign of
      applause. She, however, had caught sight of Sergius Thord and some of her
      Revolutionary friends seated 'among the gods,' and that was enough
      inspiration for her. Something,&mdash;a quite indefinable something,&mdash;a
      touch of personal or spiritual magnetism, had been fired in her young
      soul; and gradually as the Opera went on, her fellow-players became
      infected by it. Some of them gave her odd, half-laughing glances now and
      then,&mdash;being more or less amazed at the unusual vigour with which she
      sang, in her pure childish soprano, the few strophes of recitative and
      light song attached to her part;&mdash;the very prima-donna herself caught
      fire,&mdash;and the distinguished tenor, who had travelled all the way
      from Buda Pesth in haste, so that he might 'create' the chief rôle in the
      work of his friend Valdor, began to feel that there was something more in
      operatic singing than the mere inflation of the chest, and the careful
      production of perfectly-rounded notes. Valdor himself played the various
      violin solos which occurred frequently throughout the piece, and never
      failed to evoke a storm of rapturous plaudits,&mdash;and many were the
      half-indignant glances of the audience towards the Royal shrine of draped
      satin, gilding, and electric light, wherein the King, like an idol, sat,&mdash;undemonstrative,
      and apparently more bored than satisfied. There was a general feeling that
      he ought to have shown,&mdash;by his personal applause in public,&mdash;a
      proper appreciation of the many gifted artists playing that evening,
      especially in the case of Louis Valdor, the composer of the Opera itself.
      But he sat inert, only occasionally glancing at the stage, and anon
      carelessly turning away from it to converse with the members of his suite.
    </p>
    <p>
      The piece went on;&mdash;and more and more the passion of Pequita's
      pent-up little soul communicated itself to the other performers,&mdash;till
      they found themselves almost unconsciously obeying her 'lead.' At last
      came the grand final act,&mdash;where, in accordance with the progress of
      the story, the bold band of 'New Christians' are fought back from the
      gates of the Vatican by the Papal Guard; and the Roman populace, roused to
      enthusiasm, gather round their defeated ranks to defend and to aid them
      with sympathy and support in their combat,&mdash;breaking forth all
      together at last in the triumphant 'Song of Freedom.' Truly grand and
      majestic was this same song,&mdash;pulsating with truth and passion,&mdash;breathing
      with the very essence of liberty,&mdash;an echo of the heart and soul of
      strong nations who struggle, even unto death, for the lawful rights of
      humanity denied to them by the tyrants in place and power. As the superb
      roll and swell of the glorious music poured through the crowded house,
      there was an almost unconscious movement among the audience,&mdash;the
      people in the gallery rose <i>en masse</i>, and at the close of the first
      verse, responded to it by a mighty cheer, which reverberated through and
      through the immense building like thunder. The occupants of the stalls and
      boxes exchanged wondering and half-frightened looks,&mdash;then as the
      cheer subsided, settled themselves again to listen, more or less
      spell-bound, as the second verse began. Just before this had merged into
      its accompanying splendid and soul-awakening chorus,&mdash;Pequita,&mdash;having
      obtained the consent of the manager to execute her 'Dagger Dance' in the
      middle of the song, instead of at the end,&mdash;suddenly sprang towards
      the footlights in a pirouette of extravagant and exquisite velocity&mdash;while,&mdash;checked
      by a sign from the conductor, the singers ceased. Without music, in an
      absolute stillness as of death, the girl swung herself to and fro, like a
      bell-flower in the breeze,&mdash;anon she sprang and leaped like a scarlet
      flame&mdash;and again sank into a slow and voluptuous motion, as of a
      fairy who dreamingly glides on tiptoe over a field of flowers. Then, on a
      sudden, while the fascinated spectators watched her breathlessly,&mdash;she
      seemed to wake from sleep,&mdash;and running forward wildly, began to toss
      and whirl her scarlet skirts, her black curls streaming, her dark eyes
      flashing with mingled defiance and scorn, while drawing from her breast an
      unsheathed dagger, she flung it in the air, caught it dexterously by the
      hilt again, twisted and turned it in every possible way,&mdash;now
      beckoning, now repelling, now defending,&mdash;and lastly threatening,
      with a passionate intensity of action that was well-nigh irresistible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Caught by the marvellous subtlety of her performance, quite one half the
      audience now rose instinctively, all eyes being fixed on the strange
      evolutions of this whirling, flying thing that seemed possessed by the
      very devil of dancing! The King at last attracted, leaned slightly forward
      from his box with a tolerant smile,&mdash;the Queen's face was as usual,
      immovable,&mdash;the Princes Rupert and Cyprian stared, open-mouthed&mdash;while
      over the whole brilliant scene that remarkable silence brooded, like the
      sultry pause before the breaking of a storm. Triumphant, reckless,
      panting,&mdash;scarcely knowing what she did in her excitement,&mdash;Pequita,
      suddenly running backward, with the lightness of thistle-down flying
      before the wind, snatched the flag of the country from a super standing
      by, and dancing forward again, waved it aloft, till with a final
      abandonment of herself to the humour of the moment, she sprang with a
      single bound towards the Royal box, and there&mdash;the youthful
      incarnation of living, breathing passion, fury, patriotism, and exultation
      in one,&mdash;dropped on one knee, the flag waving behind her, the dagger
      pointed straight upward, full at the King!
    </p>
    <p>
      A great roar,&mdash;like that of hundreds of famished wild beasts,&mdash;answered
      this gesture; mingled with acclamations,&mdash;and when 'The Song of
      Freedom' again burst out from the singers on the stage, the whole mass of
      people joined in the chorus with a kind of melodious madness. Shouts of
      'Pequita! Pequita!' rang out on all sides,&mdash;then 'Valdor! Valdor!'&mdash;and
      then,&mdash;all suddenly,&mdash;a stentorian voice cried 'Sergius Thord!'
      At that word the house became a chaos. Men in the gallery, seized by some
      extraordinary impulse of doing they knew not what, and going they knew not
      whither, leaped over each other's shoulders, and began to climb down by
      the pillars of the balconies to the stalls,&mdash;and a universal panic
      and rush ensued. Terrified women hurried from the stalls and boxes in
      spite of warning, and got mixed with the maddened crowd, a section of
      which, pouring out of the Opera-house came incontinently upon the King's
      carriage in waiting,&mdash;and forthwith, without any reflection as to the
      why or the wherefore, smashed it to atoms! Then, singing again 'The Song
      of Freedom,'&mdash;the people, pouring out from all the doors, formed into
      a huge battalion, and started on a march of devastation and plunder.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sergius Thord, grasping the situation from the first, rushed out of the
      Opera-house in all haste, anxious to avert a catastrophe, but he was too
      late to stop the frenzied crowd,&mdash;nothing could, or would have
      stopped them at that particular moment. The fire had been too long
      smouldering in their souls; and Pequita, like a little spark of fury, had
      set it in a blaze. Through private ways and back streets, the King and
      Queen and their sons, escorted by the alarmed manager, escaped from the
      Opera unhurt,&mdash;and drove back unobserved to the Palace in a common
      fiacre&mdash;and a vast multitude, waiting to see them come out by the
      usual doors, and finding they did not come, vented their rage and disgust
      by tearing up and smashing everything within their reach. Then,
      remembering in good time, despite their excitement, that the manager of
      the Opera had done nothing to deserve injury to himself or his property,
      they paused in this work of destruction, and with the sudden caprice of
      children, gave out ringing cheers for him and for Pequita;&mdash;while
      their uncertainty as to what to do next was settled for them by Paul
      Zouche, who, mounting on one of the pedestals which supported the columns
      of the entrance to the Opera, where his wild head, glittering eyes and
      eager face looked scarcely human, cried out:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Damnation to Carl Pérousse! Why do you idle here, my friends, when you
      might be busy! If you want Freedom, seek it from him who is to be your new
      Prime Minister!"
    </p>
    <p>
      A prolonged yell of savage approval answered him,&mdash;and like an angry
      tide, the crowd swept on and on, gathering strength and force as it went,
      and pouring through the streets with fierce clamour of shouting, and clash
      of hastily collected weapons,&mdash;on and on to the great square, in the
      centre of which stood the statue of the late King, and where the house of
      Carl Pérousse occupied the most prominent position. And the moon, coming
      suddenly out of a cloud, stared whitely down upon the turbulent scene,&mdash;one
      too often witnessed in history, when, as Carlyle says, 'a Nation of men is
      suddenly hurled beyond the limits. For Nature, as green as she looks,
      rests everywhere on dread foundations, and Pan, to whose music the Nymphs
      dance, has a cry in him that can drive all men distracted!'
    </p>
    <p>
      In such distraction, and with such wild cry, the night of Pequita's
      long-looked-for dance before the King swept stormily on towards day.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXVIII. &mdash; "FATE GIVES&mdash;THE KING!"
    </h2>
    <p>
      News of this fresh and more violent disturbance among the people brought
      the soldiery out in hot haste, who galloped down to the scene of
      excitement, only to find the mounted police before them, headed by General
      Bernhoff, who careering to and fro, cool and composed, forbade, 'in the
      name of the King!' any attempt to drive the mob out of the square. Swaying
      uneasily round and round, the populace yelled and groaned, and cheered and
      hissed; not knowing exactly whereunto they were so wildly moved, but
      evidently waiting for a fresh 'lead.' The house of Carl Pérousse, with its
      handsome exterior and stately marble portico, offered itself as a tempting
      target to the more excitable roughs, and a stone sent crashing through one
      of the windows would have certainly been the signal for a general
      onslaught had not a man's figure suddenly climbed the pedestal which
      supported the statue of the late King in the centre of the square, and
      lifted its living visible identity against the frowning cold stone image
      of the dead. A cry went up from thousands of throats&mdash;'Sergius
      Thord!'&mdash;followed by an extraordinary clamour of passionate plaudits,
      as the excited people recognised the grand head and commanding aspect of
      their own particular Apostle of Liberty. He,&mdash;stretching out his
      hands with a gesture of mingled authority and entreaty,&mdash;pacified the
      raging sea of contradictory and conflicting voices as if by magic,&mdash;and
      the horrid clamour died down into a dull roar, which in its turn subsided
      into silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Friends and brothers!" he cried; "Be calm! Be patient! What spirit
      possesses you to thus destroy the chances of your own peace! What is your
      aim? Justice? Ay&mdash;justice!&mdash;but how can you gain this by being
      yourselves unjust? Will you remedy Wrong by injuring Right? Nay&mdash;this
      must not be!&mdash;this cannot be, with <i>you</i>, whose passion for
      liberty is noble,&mdash;whose love for truth is fixed and resolute,&mdash;and
      who seek no more than is by human right your own! This sudden tempest, by
      which your souls are tossed, is like an angry gust upon the sea, which
      wrecks great vessels and drowns brave men;&mdash;be something more than
      the semblance of the capricious wind which destroys without having reason
      to know why it is bent on destruction! What are you here for? What would
      you do?"
    </p>
    <p>
      A confused shouting answered him, in which cries of 'Pérousse!' and 'The
      King!' were most prominent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sergius Thord looked round upon the seething mass below him, with a
      strange sense of power and of triumph. He&mdash;even he&mdash;who could
      claim to be no more than a poor Thinker, speaker and writer,&mdash;had won
      these thousands to his command!&mdash;he had them here, willing to obey
      his lightest word,&mdash;ready to follow his signal wheresoever it might
      take them! His eyes glowed,&mdash;and the light of a great and earnest
      inspiration illumined his strong features.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You call for Carl Pérousse!" he said; "Yonder he dwells!&mdash;in the
      regal house he has built for himself out of the sweating work of the
      poor!" A fierce yell from the populace and an attempt at a rush, was again
      stopped by the speaker's uplifted hand; "Wait, friends&mdash;wait! Think
      for a moment of the result of action, before you act! Suppose you pulled
      down that palace of fraud; suppose your strong hands righteously rent it
      asunder;&mdash;suppose you set fire to its walls,&mdash;suppose you
      dragged out the robber from his cave and slew him here, before sunrise&mdash;what
      then? You would make of him a martyr!&mdash;and the hypocritical liars of
      the present policy, who are involved with him in his financial schemes,&mdash;would
      chant his praises in every newspaper, and laud his virtues in every
      sermon! Nay, we should probably hear of a special 'Memorial Service' being
      held in our great Cathedral to sanctify the corpse of the vilest
      stock-jobbing rascal that ever cheated the gallows! Be wiser than that, my
      friends! Do not soil your hands either with the body of Carl Pérousse or
      his ill-gotten dwelling. What we want for him is Disgrace, not Death!
      Death is far too easy! An innocent child may die; do not give to a
      false-hearted knave the simple exit common to the brave and true!
      Disgrace!&mdash;disgrace! Shame, confusion, and the curse of the country,&mdash;let
      these be your vengeance on the man who seeks to clutch the reins of
      government!&mdash;the man who would drive the people like whipped horses
      to their ruin!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Another roar answered him, but this time it was mingled with murmurs of
      dissatisfaction. Thord caught these up, and at once responded to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hear you, O People! I hear the clamour of your hearts and souls, which
      is almost too strong to find expression in speech! You cannot wait, you
      would tell me! You would have Pérousse dragged out here,&mdash;you would
      tear him to pieces among you, if you could, and carry the fragments of him
      to the King, to prove what a people can do with a villain proposed to them
      as their Prime Minister!" Loud and ferocious shouts answered these words,
      and he went on; "I know&mdash;I understand!&mdash;and I sympathise! But
      even as I know you, you know me! Believe me now, therefore, and hear my
      promise! I swear to you before you all"&mdash;and here he extended both
      arms with a solemn and impressive gesture&mdash;"that this month shall not
      be ended before the dishonesty of Carl Pérousse is publicly and flagrantly
      known at every street corner,&mdash;in every town and province of the
      land!&mdash;and before the most high God, I take my oath to you, the
      People,&mdash;that he shall never be the governing head of the country!"
    </p>
    <p>
      A hurricane of applause answered him&mdash;a tempest of shouting that
      seemed to surge and sway through the air and down to the earth again like
      the beating of a powerful wind.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Give me your trust, O People!" he cried, carried beyond himself with the
      excitement and fervour of the scene&mdash;"Give me yourselves!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Another roar replied to this adjuration. He stood triumphant;&mdash;the
      people pressing up around him,&mdash;some weeping&mdash;some kneeling at
      his feet&mdash;some climbing to kiss his hand. A few angry voices in the
      distance cried out&mdash;'The King!'&mdash;and he turned at once on the
      word.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who needs the King?" he demanded; "Who calls for him? What is he to us?
      What has he ever been? Look back on his career!&mdash;see him as
      Heir-Apparent to the Throne, wasting his time with dishonest associates,&mdash;dealing
      with speculators and turf gamblers&mdash;involving himself in debt&mdash;and
      pandering to vile women, who still hold him in their grasp, and who in
      their turn rule the country by their caprice, and drain the Royal coffers
      by their licentious extravagance! Now look on him as the King,&mdash;a
      tool in the hands of financiers&mdash;a speculator among speculators&mdash;steeped
      to the very eyes in the love of money, and despising all men who do not
      bear the open blazon of wealth upon them,&mdash;what has he done for the
      people? Nothing! What will he ever do for the People? Nothing! Flattered
      by self-seekers&mdash;stuffed with eulogy by a paid Press&mdash;his name
      made a byword and a mockery by the very women with whom he consorts, what
      should we do with him in Our work! Let him alone!&mdash;let him be! Let
      him eat and drink as suits his nature&mdash;and die of the poison his own
      vices breed in his blood!&mdash;we want naught of him, or his heirs! When
      the time ripens to its full fruition, we, the People, can do without a
      Throne!"
    </p>
    <p>
      At this, thousands of hats and handkerchiefs were tossed in the air,&mdash;thousands
      of voices cheered to the very echo, and to relieve their feelings still
      more completely the vast crowd once more took up 'The Song of Freedom' and
      began singing it in unison steadily and grandly, with all that resistless
      force and passion which springs from deep-seated emotion in the soul. And
      while they were singing, Thord, glancing rapidly about him, saw Johan
      Zegota close at hand, and to his still greater satisfaction, Pasquin
      Leroy; and beckoning them both to his side whispered his brief orders,
      which were at once comprehended. The day was breaking; and in the purple
      east a line of crimson showed where the sun would presently rise. A few
      minutes' quick organisation worked by Leroy and Zegota, and some few other
      of their comrades sufficed to break up the mob into three sections, and in
      perfect order they stood blocked for a moment, like the three wings of a
      great army. Then once more Thord addressed them:
    </p>
    <p>
      "People, you have heard my vow! If before the end of the month Carl
      Pérousse is not ejected with contempt from office, I will ask my death at
      your hands! A meeting will be convened next week at the People's Assembly
      Rooms where we shall make arrangements to approach the King. If the King
      refuses to receive us, we shall find means to make him do so! He <i>shall</i>
      hear us! He is our paid servant, and he is bound to serve us faithfully,&mdash;or
      the Throne shall be a thing of the past, to be looked back upon with
      regret that we, a great and free people, ever tolerated its vice and
      tyranny!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Here he waited to let the storm of plaudits subside,&mdash;and then
      continued: "Now part, all of you friends!&mdash;go your ways,&mdash;and
      keep order for yourselves with vigilance! The soldiery are here, but they
      dare not fire!&mdash;the police are here, but they dare not arrest! Give
      them no cause even to say that it would have been well to do either! Let
      the spiritual force of your determined minds,&mdash;fixed on a noble and
      just purpose, over-rule mere temporal authority; let none have to blame
      you for murder or violence,&mdash;take no life,&mdash;shed no blood; but
      let your conquest of the Government,&mdash;your capture of the Throne,&mdash;be
      a glorious moral victory, outweighing any battle gained only by brute
      force and rapine!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He was answered by a strenuous cheer; and then the three great sections of
      the multitude began to move. Out of the square in perfect order they
      marched,&mdash;still singing; one huge mass of people being headed by
      Pasquin Leroy, the other by Johan Zegota,&mdash;the third by Sergius Thord
      himself. The soldiery, seeing there was no cause for interference,
      withdrew,&mdash;the police dispersed, and once again an outbreak of
      popular disorder was checked and for a time withheld.
    </p>
    <p>
      But this second riot had startled the metropolis in good earnest. Everyone
      became fully alive to the danger and increasing force of the disaffected
      community,&mdash;and the Government,&mdash;lately grown inert and dilatory
      in the transaction of business,&mdash;began seriously to consider ways and
      means of pacifying general clamour and public dissatisfaction. None of the
      members of the Cabinet were much surprised, therefore, when they each
      received a summons from the King to wait upon him at the Palace that day
      week,&mdash;'to discuss affairs of national urgency,' and the general
      impression appeared to be, that though Carl Pérousse dismissed the 'street
      rowdyism,' as he called it, with contempt, and spoke of 'disloyal traitors
      opposed to the Government,' he was nevertheless riding for a fall; and
      that his chances of obtaining the Premiership were scarcely so sure as
      they had hitherto seemed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, Pequita, whose childish rage against the King for not noticing
      her dancing or applauding it, had been the trifling cause of the sudden
      volcanic eruption of the public mind, became more than ever the idol of
      the hour. The night after the riot, the Opera-house was crowded to
      suffocation,&mdash;and the stage was covered with flowers. Among the
      countless bouquets offered to the triumphant little dancer, came one which
      was not thrown from the audience, but was brought to her by a messenger;
      it was a great cluster of scarlet carnations, and attached to it was a
      tiny velvet case, containing the ring promised to her by Pasquin Leroy,
      when, as he had said, she 'should dance before the King.' A small card
      accompanied it on which was written 'Pequita, from Pasquin!' Turning to
      Lotys, who, in the event of further turbulence, had accompanied her to the
      Opera that night to take care of her, and who sat grave, pale, and
      thoughtful, in one of the dressing-rooms near the stage, the child eagerly
      showed her the jewel, exclaiming:
    </p>
    <p>
      "See! He has kept his promise!"
    </p>
    <p>
      And Lotys,&mdash;sighing even while she smiled,&mdash;answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, dear! He would not be the brave man he is, if he ever broke his
      word!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Whereat Pequita slipped the ring on her friend's finger, kissing her and
      whispering:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Take care of it for me! Wear it for me! For tonight, at least!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Lotys assented,&mdash;though with a little reluctance,&mdash;and it was
      only while Pequita was away from her, performing her part on the stage,
      that this strange lonely woman bent her face down on the hand adorned with
      the star-like gem and kissed it,&mdash;tears standing in her eyes as she
      murmured:
    </p>
    <p>
      "My love&mdash;my love! If you only knew!"
    </p>
    <p>
      And then the hot colour surged into her cheeks for sheer shame of herself
      that she should love!&mdash;she&mdash;no longer in her youth,&mdash;and
      utterly unconscious that there was, or could be any beauty in her deep
      lustrous eyes, white skin, and dull gold hair. What had she to do with the
      thoughts of passion?&mdash;she whose life was devoted to the sick and
      needy,&mdash;and who had no right to think of anything else but how she
      should aid them best, so long as that life should last! She knew well
      enough that love of a great, jealous, and almost savage kind, was hers if
      she chose to claim it&mdash;the love of Sergius Thord, who worshipped her
      both as a woman and an Intellect; but she could not contemplate him as her
      lover, having grown up to consider him more as a sort of paternal guardian
      and friend. In fact, she had thoroughly resigned herself to think of
      nothing but work for the remainder of her days, and to entirely forego the
      love and tenderness which most women, even the poorest, have the natural
      right to win; and now slowly,&mdash;almost unconsciously to herself,&mdash;Love
      had stolen into her soul and taken possession of it;&mdash;secret love for
      the man, who brave almost to recklessness, had joined his fortunes in with
      Sergius Thord and his companions, and had assisted the work of pushing
      matters so far forward, that the wrongs done to the poor, and the numerous
      injustices of the law, which for years had been accumulating, and had
      become part and parcel of the governing system of the country, now stood a
      fair chance of being remedied. She, with her quick woman's instinct, had
      perceived that where Sergius Thord, in his dreamy idealism, halted and was
      uncertain of results, Pasquin Leroy stepped into the breach and won the
      victory. And, like all courageous women, she admired a courageous man. Not
      that Thord lacked courage,&mdash;he had plenty of the physical brute force
      known as such,&mdash;but he had also a peculiar and uncomfortable quality
      of rousing desires, both in himself and others which he had not the means
      of gratifying.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus Lotys foresaw that, unless by some miraculous chance he obtained both
      place and power, and a share in the ruling of things, there was every
      possibility of a split in the Revolutionary Committee,&mdash;one half
      being inclined to indulge in the criminal and wholly wasteful spirit of
      Anarchy,&mdash;the other disposed to throw in its lot with the Liberal or
      Radical side of politics. And she began to regard Pasquin Leroy, with his
      even temperament, cool imperturbability, intellectual daring, and literary
      ability, as the link which kept them all together, and gave practical
      force to the often brooding and fantastic day-dreams of Thord, who, though
      he made plans night and day for the greater freedom and relief of the
      People from unjust coercion, had not succeeded in obtaining as yet
      sufficient power to carry them into execution.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was evident, however, to the whole country that the times were in a
      ferment,&mdash;that the Government was growing more unpopular, and that
      Carl Pérousse, the chief hinge on which Governmental force turned, was
      under a cloud of the gravest suspicion. Meetings, more or less stormy in
      character, were held everywhere by every shade of party in politics,&mdash;and
      strong protests against his being nominated as Premier were daily sent to
      the King. But to the surprise of many, and the annoyance of most, his
      Majesty gave no sign. The newspapers burst into rampant argument,&mdash;every
      little editor issued his Jovian 'opinion' on the grave issues at stake;&mdash;David
      Jost kept his Hebraic colours flying for the King,&mdash;judging that to
      flatter Royalty was always a safe course for most Jews;&mdash;while in the
      rival journal, brilliant essays, leaders and satires on the political
      situation, combined with point-blank accusations against the Secretary of
      State, (which that distinguished personage always failed to notice,) flew
      from the pen of the mysterious writer, Pasquin Leroy, and occupied
      constant public attention. Unlike the realm of Britain,&mdash;where the
      'golden youth' enfeeble their intellects by the perusal of such poor and
      slangy journalism that they have lost both the art and wit to comprehend
      brilliant political writing,&mdash;the inhabitants of this particular
      corner of the sunny south were always ready to worship genius wherever
      even the smallest glimmer of it appeared,&mdash;and the admiration Leroy's
      writings excited was fast becoming universal, though for the most part
      these writings were extremely inflammable in nature, and rated both King
      and Court soundly. But with the usual indifference of Royalty to 'genius'
      generally, the King, when asked if he had taken note of certain articles
      dealing very freely with both him and his social conduct, declared he had
      never heard of them, or of their writer!
    </p>
    <p>
      "I never," he said with an odd smile, "pay any attention to clever
      literature! I should be establishing a precedent which would be
      inconvenient and disagreeable to my fellow sovereigns!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The time went on; the King met his Ministers on the day he had summoned
      them in private council,&mdash;and on the other hand Sergius Thord
      convened a mighty mass-meeting for the purpose of carrying a resolution
      formed to address his Majesty on the impending question of the
      Premiership. From the King's council, the heads of Government came away in
      haste, despair and confusion; from the mass-meeting whole regiments
      marched through the streets in triumphant and satisfied order.
    </p>
    <p>
      After these events there came a night, when the sweet progress of calm
      weather was broken up by cloud and storm,&mdash;and when heavy thunder
      boomed over the city at long dull intervals, like the grinding and
      pounding of artillery, without any rain to cool the heated ether, which
      was now and again torn asunder by flashes of lightning. There was
      evidently a raging tempest far out at sea, though the land only received
      suggestions of this by the occasional rearing up of huge dark green
      billows which broke against the tall cliffs, plumed with mimosa and
      myrtle, that guarded the coast. Heavy scents of flowers were in the air&mdash;heavy
      heat weighed down the atmosphere,&mdash;and there was a languor in the
      slow footsteps of the men, who, singly, or in groups, arrived at the door
      of Sergius Thord's house to fulfil the dread compact binding upon them all
      in regard to the 'Day of Fate.' Pasquin Leroy and his two companions were
      among the first to arrive, and to make their way up the dark steep stairs
      to the Committee room, where, when they entered, they found the usual
      aspect of things strangely altered. The table no longer occupied its
      position in the middle of the floor; it was set on a raised platform
      entirely draped with black. Large candelabra, holding six lights each,
      occupied either end,&mdash;and in the centre one solitary red lamp was
      placed, shedding its flare over a large bronze vessel shaped like a
      funeral urn. The rest of the room was in darkness,&mdash;and with the
      gathering groups of men, who moved silently and spoke in whispers, it
      presented a solemn and eerie spectacle.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah! You have now arrived," said Max Graub, in a cautious sotto voce to
      Leroy, "at the end of your adventures! Behold the number Thirteen! Six
      lights at one end, six lights at the other,&mdash;that is twelve; and in
      the centre the Thirteenth&mdash;the red Eye looking into the sepulchral
      urn! It is all up with us!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Leroy said nothing,&mdash;but the face of the man called Axel Regor grew
      suddenly very pale. He drew Leroy a little aside.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This is no laughing matter!" he said very earnestly; "Let me stand near
      you&mdash;let me keep close at your side all the evening!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Leroy smiled and pressed his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear fellow!" he said; "Have no fear! Or if you have fear, do not show
      it! You stand in precisely the same danger as myself, or as any of us; you
      may draw the fatal Signal!&mdash;but if you do, I promise you I will
      volunteer myself in your place."
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>You</i>!" said Regor with a volume of meaning in the utterance; "You
      would stand in my place?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, of course!" replied Leroy cheerily; "Life is not such a wonderful
      business, that death for a friend's sake is not better!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Regor looked at him, and a speechless devotion filled and softened his
      eyes. Certain words spoken to him by a woman he loved echoed through his
      brain, and he murmured:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nay, by the God above us, if death is in question, <i>I</i> will die
      rather than let <i>you</i> die!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That will depend on my humour!" said Leroy, still smiling; "You will
      require my permission to enter into combat with the last enemy before he
      offers challenge!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Max Graub here approached them with a warning finger laid on his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hush&mdash;sh&mdash;sh!" he said; "Think as much as you like,&mdash;but
      talk as little as you can! I assure you this is a most uncomfortable
      business!&mdash;and here comes the axis of the revolving wheel!"
    </p>
    <p>
      They made way,&mdash;as did all the men grouped together in the room,&mdash;for
      the entrance of Sergius Thord and Lotys. These two came in together; and
      with a silent salute which included the whole Committee, ascended the
      raised platform. Lotys was deadly pale; and the white dress she wore, with
      its scarlet sash, accentuated that paleness. She appeared for once to move
      under the dominance of some greater will than her own,&mdash;she moved
      slowly, and her head was bent,&mdash;and even to Pasquin Leroy as she
      passed him, her faint smile of recognition was both sad and cold. Once on
      the platform, she seated herself at the lower end of the funereally-draped
      table; and leaning her head on one hand, seemed lost in thought. Thord
      took his place at the opposite end,&mdash;whereupon Johan Zegota moving
      stealthily to the door, closed it, locked it, and put the key in his
      pocket. Then he in turn mounted the platform, and began in a clear but low
      voice to call the roll of the members of the Committee.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each man answered to his name in the same guarded tone; all without a
      single exception were present;&mdash;and Zegota, having completed the
      catalogue, turned to Thord for further instructions. The rest of the
      company then seated themselves,&mdash;finding their chairs with some
      little difficulty in the semi-darkness. When the noise of their shuffling
      feet had ceased, Thord rose and advanced to the front of the platform.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Friends," he said slowly; "You are here to-night to determine by the hand
      of Chance, or Destiny, which of certain traitors among many thousands,
      shall meet with the punishment his treachery deserves. In the list of
      those who are to-night marked down for death is Carl Pérousse;&mdash;happy
      the man that draws <i>that</i> name and is able to serve as the liberator
      to his country! Another, is the Jew, David Jost,&mdash;because it has been
      chiefly at his persuasion that the heads of the Government have been
      tempted to gamble for their own personal motives with the secrets of State
      policy. Another, is the Marquis de Lutera;&mdash;who though he has,
      possibly through fear, resigned office, is to blame for having made his
      own private fortune,&mdash;as well as the fortunes of all the members of
      his family,&mdash;out of the injuries and taxations inflicted on the
      People. To his suggestion we owe the cruel price of bread,&mdash;the tax
      on corn, a necessity of life;&mdash;on his policy rests the responsibility
      of opening our Trades to such an over-excess of Foreign Competition and
      Supply that our native work and our native interests are paralysed by the
      strain. To him,&mdash;as well as to Carl Pérousse, we owe the ridiculous
      urbanities of such extreme foreign diplomacies as expose our secret forces
      of war to our rivals;&mdash;from him emanates the courteous and almost
      servile attention with which we foolishly exhibit our naval and military
      defences to our enemies. We assume that a Minister who graciously permits
      a foreign arsenal to copy our guns&mdash;a foreign dockyard to copy and to
      emulate our ships,&mdash;is a traitor to the prosperity and continued
      power of the country. Two of the great leaders in Trade are named on the
      Death-list;&mdash;one because, in spite of many warnings, he employs
      foreign workmen only; the other, because he 'sweats' native labour. The
      removal of all these persons will be a boon to the country&mdash;the
      clearing of a plague of rats from the national House and Exchequer!
      Lastly, the King is named;&mdash;because,&mdash;though he has rescued the
      system of National Education from Jesuit interference and threatening
      priestly dominance, he has turned a deaf ear to other equally pressing
      petitions of his People,&mdash;and also because he does nothing to either
      influence or guide society to its best and highest ends. Under his rule,
      learning is set at naught&mdash;Art, Science and Literature, the three
      saving graces which make for the peace, prosperity and fraternity of
      nations,&mdash;are rendered valueless, because no example is set which
      would give them their rightful prominence,&mdash;and wine, cards and women
      are substituted,&mdash;the three evil fates between which the honour of
      the Throne is brought into contempt. We should know and remember that
      Lotys, when she lately saved the life of the King, did,&mdash;as she
      herself can tell you,&mdash;plead personally with him to save the people
      from the despotic government of Carl Pérousse and his pernicious
      'majority';&mdash;but though she rescued the monarch at the risk of her
      own much more valuable existence&mdash;and equally at the risk of being
      misunderstood and condemned by this very Society to which her heart and
      soul are pledged,&mdash;he refused to even consider her entreaty.
      Therefore, we may be satisfied that he has been warned;&mdash;but it would
      seem that the warning is of no avail;&mdash;and whosoever to-night draws
      the name of the King must be swift and sure in his business!"
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a deep pause. Suddenly Max Graub rose, his bulky form and great
      height giving him an almost Titanesque appearance in the gloom of the
      chamber. Raising one hand as a signal, he asked permission to speak, which
      was instantly accorded.
    </p>
    <p>
      "To my chief, Sergius Thord, and my comrades," he said with a slight
      military salutation; "I wish to explain what perhaps they have already
      discovered,&mdash;that I am a poor and uncouth German,&mdash;not
      altogether conversant with your language,&mdash;and considerably
      bewildered by your social ethics;&mdash;so that if I do not entirely
      understand things as I should, you will perhaps pardon my ignorance, which
      includes other drawbacks of my disposition. But when death is in question,
      I am always much interested,&mdash;having spent all my days in trying to
      find out ways and means of combating man's chief enemy on his own ground.
      Because,&mdash;though I fully admit the usefulness of death as a cleanser
      and solvent; and as a means of clearing off hopelessly-useless persons, I
      am not at all sure that it is an advisable way to get rid of the healthy
      and the promising. I speak as a physician merely,&mdash;with an eye to
      what is called the 'stock' of the human race; and what I now want to know
      is this: On what scientific, ethical, or religious grounds, do you wish to
      get rid of the King? Science, ethics, and religion being only in the
      present day so many forms of carefully ministering to one's Self, and
      one's own particular humour, you will understand that I mean,&mdash;as
      concerns the 'happy dispatch' of this same King,&mdash;what good will it
      do to you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a silence. No one vouchsafed any explanation. After a
      considerable pause, Thord replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It will do us no good. But it will show the country that we exist to
      revenge injustice!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But&mdash;is the King unjust?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can you ask it?" replied Thord with a certain grave patience. "During
      your association with us, have you not learned?&mdash;and do you not
      know?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sit down, Graub!" interrupted Pasquin Leroy suddenly; "I know the King's
      ways well enough,&mdash;and I can swear upon my honour that he deserves
      the worst that can be done to him!"
    </p>
    <p>
      A murmur of sullen approval ran through the room, and somewhat lowering
      glances were cast at the audacious Graub, who had, by his few words,
      created the very undesirable impression that he wished, in some remote
      way, to interfere with the Committee solemnities in progress, and to
      defend the King from attack. He sat down again looking more or less
      crushed and baffled,&mdash;and Thord went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We have little time to spend together to-night, and none to waste. Let
      each man come forward now, and take his chance,&mdash;remembering,&mdash;lest
      his courage fail him,&mdash;that whatever work is given him to do, this
      Committee are sworn to stand by him as their associate and comrade!&mdash;to
      defend him,&mdash;even at the risk of their own lives!&mdash;and to share
      completely in the consequences of whatever act he may be called upon to
      perform in the faithful following of his duty! Friends, repeat with me all
      together, the Vow of Fealty!"
    </p>
    <p>
      At once every man rose,&mdash;and all lifting their right hands on high
      repeated in steady tones the following formula after their Chief,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "We swear in the name of God, and by the eternal glory of Freedom! That
      whosoever among us this night shall draw the Red Cross Signal which
      destines him to take from life, a life proved unworthy,&mdash;shall be to
      us a sacred person, and an object of defence and continued protection! We
      guarantee to shield him at all times and under all circumstances;&mdash;we
      promise to fight for him against the utmost combined power of the law;&mdash;we
      are prepared to maintain an inviolate silence concerning his movements,
      his actions and their ultimate result,&mdash;even to the sufferance of
      imprisonment, punishment and death for his sake! And may the curse of the
      Almighty Creator of Heaven and Earth be upon us and our children, and our
      children's children, if we break this vow. Amen!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The stern and impressive intensity with which these words were spoken sent
      a slight tremor along even such steel-like nerves as those of Pasquin
      Leroy, though he repeated the formula after Sergius Thord with the
      attentive care of a child saying a lesson. At its conclusion, however, a
      sudden thought flashed through his brain which brought a wonderful smile
      to his lips, and a rare light in his eyes, and touching the arm of Axel
      Regor, he whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Could anything be more protective to me,&mdash;<i>as you know me</i>,&mdash;than
      this Vow of Fealty? By my faith, a right loyal vow!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The man he so questioned looked at him doubtfully. He did not understand.
      He himself had repeated the vow mechanically and without thought, being
      occupied in serious and uncomfortable meditation as to what possible
      dangerous lengths the evening's business might be carried. And, accustomed
      as he now was to the varying and brilliant moods of one whom he had proved
      to be of most varying and brilliant intelligence, his brain was not quick
      enough to follow the lightning-like speed of the chain of ideas,&mdash;all
      moving in a perfectly organised plan,&mdash;conceived by this daring,
      scheming and original brain, which had been so lately roused to its own
      powers and set in thinking, working order. He therefore merely expressed
      his mind's bewilderment by a warning glance mingled with alarm, which
      caused Leroy to smile again,&mdash;but the scene which was being enacted,
      now demanded their closest attention, and they had no further opportunity
      of exchanging so much as a word.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Vow of Fealty being duly sworn, Sergius Thord stood aside, and made
      way for Lotys, who, rising from her seat, lifted the funeral urn from the
      table and held it out towards the men. She made a strange and weird
      picture standing thus,&mdash;her white arms gleaming like sculptured ivory
      against the dark bronze of the metal vase,&mdash;her gold hair touched
      with a blood-like hue from the reflection of the red lamp behind her,&mdash;and
      her face,&mdash;infinitely mournful and resigned,&mdash;wearing the
      expression of one who, forced to behold evil, has no active part in it. As
      she took up her position in the front of the platform, Thord again spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let each man now advance and draw his fate! Whosoever receives a blank is
      exempt for another year;&mdash;whosoever draws the name of a victim must
      be prepared to do his duty!"
    </p>
    <p>
      This order was at once obeyed. Each man rose separately and approaching
      Lotys, saluted her first, and then drew a folded paper from the vessel she
      held. But they moved forward reluctantly,&mdash;and most of their faces
      were very pale. When Pasquin Leroy's turn came to draw, he raised his eyes
      to the woman's countenance above him and marvelled at its cold fixity. She
      seemed scarcely to be herself,&mdash;and it was plainly evident that the
      part she was forced to play in the evening's drama was a most reluctant
      one.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last all the lots were taken, and Johan Zegota lit up the gas-burners
      in the centre of the room. A sigh of relief came from the lips of many of
      the men who, on opening their papers found a blank instead of a name. But
      Leroy, unfolding his, sat in dumb amazement,&mdash;feeling, and not for
      the first time either, that surely God, or some special Providence, is
      always on the side of a strong man's just aim, fulfilling it to entire
      accomplishment. For to him was assigned the Red Cross, marked with the
      name of 'The King!' The words of Sergius Thord, uttered that very night,
      rushed back on his mind;&mdash;"Whosoever draws the name of the King must
      be swift and sure in his business!"
    </p>
    <p>
      His heart beat high; he occupied at that moment a position no man in all
      the world had ever occupied before;&mdash;he was the centre of a drama
      such as had never before been enacted,&mdash;he had the greatest move to
      play on the chess-board of life that could possibly be desired;&mdash;and
      the greatest chance to prove himself the Man he was, that had ever been
      given to one of his quality. His brain whirled,&mdash;his pulses throbbed,&mdash;his
      eyes rested on Lotys with a passionate longing; something of the god-like
      as well as the heroic warmed his soul,&mdash;for Danger and Death stood as
      intimately close to him as Safety and Victory! What a strange, what a
      marvellous card he held in the game of life!&mdash;and yet one false move
      might mean ruin and annihilation! As in a dream he saw the members of the
      Committee go up, one by one, to Sergius Thord, who, as each laid their
      open papers before him, declared their contents. When Paul Zouche's paper
      was declared he was found to have drawn Carl Pérousse, whereat he smiled
      grimly; and retired to his seat, walking rather unsteadily. Max Graub had
      drawn a blank,&mdash;so had Axel Regor,&mdash;so had Louis Valdor and many
      others.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last it came to Leroy's turn, and as he walked up to the platform and
      ascended it, there was a look on his face which attracted the instant
      attention of all present. His eyes were singularly bright,&mdash;his lithe
      handsome figure seemed taller and more erect,&mdash;he bore himself with a
      proud, even grand air,&mdash;and Lotys, moved at last from her chill and
      melancholy apathy, gazed at him as he approached, with eyes in which a
      profound sadness was mingled with the dark tenderness of many passionate
      thoughts and dreams. He laid down his paper before Thord, who, taking it
      up read aloud:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Our friend and comrade, Pasquin Leroy, has received the Red Cross
      Signal."
    </p>
    <p>
      Then pausing before uttering his next words he raised his voice a little,
      so that he might be heard by everyone in the room, and added slowly:
    </p>
    <p>
      "To Pasquin Leroy, Fate gives&mdash;the King!"
    </p>
    <p>
      A low murmur of deep applause ran through the room. Max Graub and Axel
      Regor sprang up with a kind of smothered cry, but Leroy stood immovable.
      Instead of returning to his seat as the others had done, he remained
      standing on the platform in front of the Committee table, between Lotys
      and Sergius Thord. A strange smile rested on his lips,&mdash;his attitude
      was inexplicable. Surveying all the men's faces which were grouped before
      him in a kind of chiaro-oscuro, he studied them for a moment, and then
      turned his head towards Thord.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sergius,&mdash;so far, I have served you well! Destiny has now chosen me
      out for even a greater service! May I speak a few words?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Thord assented,&mdash;but a sudden sense of inquietude stirred in him as
      he saw that Lotys had half risen, that her lips quivered, and that great
      tears stood in her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She grieves!" he thought, sullenly, in his strange and confused way of
      balancing justice and injustice&mdash;"She grieves that the worthless life
      of the King she saved, is now to be taken by a righteous hand!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile Leroy faced the assembly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Comrades!" he said; "This is the first time I have assisted in the work
      of your Day of Fate,&mdash;the first time I have recognised how entirely
      Providence moves <i>with</i> you and <i>for</i> you in the ruling of your
      destinies! And because it is the first time, our Chief permits me to
      address you with the same fraternal liberty which was allowed to me on the
      night I became enrolled among you, as one of you! Since then, I have done
      my best to serve you&mdash;" here he was interrupted by applause&mdash;"and
      so far as it has been humanly possible, I have endeavoured to carry out
      your views and desires because,&mdash;though many of them spring from pure
      idealism, and are, I fear, impossible of realisation in this world,&mdash;they
      contain the seed of much useful and necessary reform in many institutions
      of this country. I have&mdash;as I promised you&mdash;shaken the
      stronghold of Carl Pérousse;"&mdash;again the applause broke out, none the
      less earnest because it was restrained. "I have destroyed the press-power
      and prestige of that knavish Jew-speculator in false news, David Jost; and
      wherever the wishes of this Society could be fulfilled, I have honestly
      sought to fulfil them. On this night, of all nights in the year, I should
      like to feel, and to know, that you acknowledge me as your true comrade
      and faithful friend!"
    </p>
    <p>
      At this, the whole of the company gave vent to an outburst of cheering.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you doubt our love, that you ask of it?&mdash;or our gratitude that
      you seek to have it expressed?" said Thord, leaning forward to clasp his
      hand;&mdash;"Surely you know you have given new life and impetus to our
      work!&mdash;and that you have gained fresh triumph for our Cause!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Leroy smiled,&mdash;but though returning his grasp cordially, he said
      nothing to him in person by way of reply, evidently preferring rather to
      address the whole community than one, even though that one was his
      acknowledged Chief.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thank you all!" he said in response to the acclamations around him. "I
      thank you for so heartily acknowledging me as your fellow-worker! I thank
      you for giving me your confidence and employing my services! Tonight&mdash;the
      most important night of my destiny&mdash;Fate has determined that I shall
      perform the greatest task of all you have ever allotted to me; and that
      with swiftness and sureness in the business I shall kill the King! He is
      my marked victim! I am his chosen assassin!" Here interrupting himself
      with a bright smile, he said: "Will someone restrain my two friends, Max
      Graub and Axel Regor from springing out of their seats? They are both
      extremely envious of the task which has been allotted to me!&mdash;both
      are disappointed that it did not fall to them to perform,&mdash;but I am
      not in the humour for arguing so nice a point of honour with them just
      now!"
    </p>
    <p>
      A laugh went round the company, and the two delinquents thus called to
      order, and who had really been seeking in quite a wild and aimless way, to
      scramble out of their seats and make for the platform, resumed their
      places with heads bent low, lest those around them should see the deadly
      pallor of their countenances. Leroy resumed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I rejoice, friends and comrades, that I have been elected to the high
      task of removing from the Throne one who has long been unworthy of it!&mdash;one
      who has wasted his opportunities both in youth and middle-age,&mdash;and
      who, by his own fault in a great measure, has lost much of the love and
      confidence of his people! I am glad and proud to be the one chosen to put
      an end to the career of a monarch whose vices and follies&mdash;which
      might have suited a gambler and profligate&mdash;are entirely unbecoming
      to the Sovereign Ruler of a great Realm! I shall have no fear in carrying
      out my appointed duty to the letter! I here declare my acceptance of
      whatever punishment may be visited on one who removes from life a King who
      brings kingliness into contempt! And,&mdash;as our Chief, Sergius Thord,
      suggested to-night,&mdash;I shall be swift and sure in the business!&mdash;there
      shall be no delay!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Here, as he spoke he drew a pistol from his pocket and turned the muzzle
      towards himself,&mdash;at which unexpected action there was a hasty
      movement of surprise, terror and confusion among the company.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Gentlemen all! Friends! Brothers!&mdash;as you have been,&mdash;and are
      to me,&mdash;by the binding of our compact in the name of Lotys! It is the
      determination of destiny,&mdash;as it is your desire,&mdash;that I should
      kill the King! You have resolved upon it. You are sure that his death will
      benefit the country. You have decided not to take into consideration any
      of his possible good qualities, or to pity any of the probable sorrows and
      difficulties besetting him in the uneasy position he is compelled to
      occupy. You are quite certain among yourselves, that somehow or other his
      removal will bring about that ideal condition of society which many
      philosophers have written of, and which many reformers have desired, but
      which has till now, proved itself incapable of being realised. The King's
      death, you think, will better all existing conditions, and you wish me to
      fulfil not only the call of destiny, but your own desire. Be it so! I am
      ready to obey! I will kill the King at once!&mdash;here and now! I <i>am</i>
      the King!"

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXIX. &mdash; THE COMRADE OF HIS FOES
    </h2>
    <p>
      This bold declaration, boldly spoken, had the startling effect of a sudden
      and sharp flash of lightning in dense darkness. Amazement and utter
      stupefaction held every man for the moment paralysed. Had a volcano
      suddenly opened beneath their feet and belched forth its floods of fire
      and lava, it could not have rendered them more helplessly stricken and
      speechless.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I <i>am</i> the King!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The words appeared to blaze on the air before them,&mdash;like the
      handwriting on the wall at Belshazzar's feast. The King! He,&mdash;their
      friend, their advocate, he&mdash;Pasquin Leroy,&mdash;the most obedient,
      the most daring and energetic of all the workers in their Cause&mdash;he&mdash;even
      he&mdash;was the King! Was it,&mdash;could it be possible! Their eyes&mdash;all
      riveted in fearful fascination upon him as he stood before them wholly at
      their mercy, but cool, dauntless, and smilingly ready to die,&mdash;had
      the wild uncomprehending stare of delirium;&mdash;the silence in the room
      was intense, breathless and terrible. Suddenly, like a lion roused,
      Sergius Thord, with a half-savage movement, sprang forward and seized him
      roughly by the arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You,&mdash;you are the King?" he said; "You,&mdash;Pasquin Leroy?" and
      struggling for breath, his words almost choked him. "<i>You</i>! Enemy in
      the guise of friend! You have fooled us! You have deceived us&mdash;you&mdash;!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Take care, Sergius!" said the monarch smiling, as he gently disengaged
      himself from the fierce hand that clutched him; "This pistol is loaded,&mdash;not
      to shoot you with!&mdash;but myself!&mdash;at your command! It would be
      unfortunate if it went off and killed the wrong man by accident!"
    </p>
    <p>
      His indomitable courage was irresistible; and Thord, relaxing his grasp,
      fell back in something like awe. And then the spell of horror and
      amazement that had struck the rest of the assemblage dumb, broke all at
      once into a sort of wild-beast clamour. Every man 'rushed' for the
      platform&mdash;and Max Graub and Axel Regor, taking swift and conscious
      possession of their true personalities as Professor von Glauben and Sir
      Roger de Launay, fought silently and determinedly to keep back the
      crowding hands that threatened instant violence to the person of their
      Royal master.
    </p>
    <p>
      A complete hubbub and confusion reigned;&mdash;cries of "Traitor!" and
      "Spy!" were hurled from one voice to another; but before a single member
      of the Committee could reach the spot where stood the undaunted Sovereign
      whom they had so lately idolised as their friend and helper, and whom they
      were now ready to tear to pieces, Lotys flung herself in front of him,
      while at the same moment she snatched the pistol he held from his hand,
      and fired it harmlessly into the air. The loud report&mdash;the flash of
      fire,&mdash;startled all the men, who gaped upon her, thunderstruck.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Through me!" she cried, her blue eyes flashing glorious menace; "Through
      me your shots! Through me your daggers! On me your destroying hands!
      Through my body alone shall you reach this King! Stand back all of you!
      What would you do? King or commoner, he is your comrade and associate!
      Sovereign or servant, he is the bravest man among you! Touch him who dare!
      Remember your Vow of Fealty!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Transfigured into an almost sublime beauty by the fervour of her emotion,
      she looked the supreme incarnation of inspired womanhood, and the
      infuriated men fell back, dismayed and completely overwhelmed by the
      strong conviction of her words, and the amazing situation in which they
      found themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was true!&mdash;he, the King,&mdash;whom they had accepted and known as
      Pasquin Leroy,&mdash;was verily their own comrade! He had proved himself a
      thousand times their friend and helper!&mdash;they had sworn to defend him
      at the cost of their own lives, if need be,&mdash;to shelter and protect
      him in all circumstances, and to accept all the consequences of whatever
      danger he might run in the performance of his duty. His duty now,&mdash;according
      to the fatal drawing of lots,&mdash;was that he should kill the King; and
      he had declared himself ready to fulfil the task by killing himself! But&mdash;as
      he was their comrade&mdash;they were bound in honour to guard his life!
    </p>
    <p>
      These bewildering and maddening thoughts coursed like fire through the
      brain of Sergius Thord,&mdash;the while his eyes, grown suddenly dark and
      bloodshot, rested wonderingly on the tall upright figure of the monarch,
      standing quietly face to face with the blood-thirsty Revolutionary
      Committee, entirely unmoved by their fierce and lowering looks, and on
      Lotys, white, beautiful and breathless, kneeling at his feet! A crushing
      sense of impotence and failure rushed over his soul like a storm wave,&mdash;his
      brain grew thick with the hurrying confusion, and a great cry, like that
      of a wounded animal, broke from his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My God! My God! All my life's work lost&mdash;in a single moment!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The King heard. Gently, and with careful courtesy, raising Lotys from the
      position in which she had thrown herself to guard him from attack for the
      second time, he pressed her hands tenderly in his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Trust me!" he whispered; "Have no fear! Not a man among them will touch
      me now!"
    </p>
    <p>
      With a slight gesture he signed her back to the chair she had previously
      occupied. She sank into it, trembling from head to foot, but her eyes
      feverishly brilliant and watchful, were widely open and alert, ready to
      note the least movement or look that indicated further danger. Then the
      King addressed himself to Thord.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sergius, I am entirely in your hands! I wait your word of command! You
      are armed,&mdash;all my companions here are armed also! But Lotys has
      deprived me of the only weapon I possessed,&mdash;though there are plenty
      more in the room to be had on loan. What say you? Shall I kill the King?
      Or will you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Thord was silent. A strong shudder shook his frame. The King laid a firm
      hand on his shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Friend!" he said in a low voice; "Believe me, I am your friend more than
      ever!&mdash;you never had, and never will have a truer one than I! All
      your life's work lost, you say? Nay, not so! It is gained! You conquered
      the People before I knew you,&mdash;and now you have conquered the
      People's King!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Slowly Thord raised his great, dark, passionate eyes, clouded black with
      thoughts which could find no adequate expression. The look in them went
      straight to the monarch's heart. Baffled ambition,&mdash;the hunger of
      greatness,&mdash;the desire to do something that should raise his soul
      above such common ruck of human emmets as make of the earth the merest
      ant-hill whereon to eat and breed and die;&mdash;all this pent-up emotion
      swam luminously in the fierce bright orbs, which like mirrors, reflected
      the picture of the troubled mind within. The suppressed power of the man,
      who, apart from his confused notions of 'liberty, equality, and
      fraternity' could resort to the sternest and most self-endangering
      measures for destroying what he considered the abuses of the law, had
      moved the King, while disguised as Pasquin Leroy, to the profoundest
      admiration for his bold character;&mdash;but perhaps he was never more
      moved than at this supreme moment, when, hopelessly entangled in a net of
      most unexpected weaving, the redoubtable Socialist had to confess himself
      vanquished by the simple friendship and service of the very monarchy he
      sought to destroy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sergius," said the King again,&mdash;"Trust me! Trust me as your
      Sovereign, with the same trust that you gave to me as your comrade,
      Pasquin! For I am still your comrade, remember! Nothing can undo the oath
      that binds me to you and to the People! I have not become one of you to
      betray you; but to serve you! Our present position is certainly a strange
      one!&mdash;for by the tenets you hold, we should be sworn opponents,
      instead of, as we are, sworn friends! Political agitators would have set
      us one against the other for their own selfish ends; as matters stand, we
      are united in the People's Cause; and I may perhaps do you more good
      living than dead! Give me a chance to serve you even better than I have
      done as yet! Still,&mdash;if you judge my death would be an advantage to
      the country,&mdash;you have but to say the word! I have sworn,&mdash;and I
      am ready to carry out the full accomplishment of my vow! Do you
      understand? You are, by the rules of this Committee my Chief!&mdash;there
      are no kings here; and I am good soldier enough to obey orders! It is for
      you to speak!&mdash;straightly, plainly, and at once,&mdash;to the
      Committee,&mdash;and to me!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Before God, you are brave!" muttered Thord, gazing at him in reluctant
      admiration. "So brave, that it is almost impossible to believe that you
      can be a King!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Speak! Speak, my friend!" he urged; "Our comrades are watching our
      conference like famished tigers! Give them food!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus adjured, Thord advanced, and confronted the murmuring, gesticulating
      crowd of men, some of whom were wrathfully expostulating with Johan
      Zegota, because he declined to unlock the door of the room and let them
      out, till he had received his Chief's commands to do so. Others were
      grouped round Paul Zouche, who had sat apparently stricken immovable in
      his chair ever since the King had declared his identity; and others showed
      themselves somewhat inclined to 'hustle' Sir Roger de Launay and Professor
      von Glauben, who guarded the approach to the platform like sentinels,&mdash;though
      they were discreet enough to show no weapons of defence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Comrades!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The rich, deep voice of their leader thrilled through the room, and
      brought them all to silence and attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Comrades!" said Thord slowly,&mdash;his accents vibrating with the
      deepest emotion. "I desire and command you all to be satisfied that no
      wrong has been done to you! I ask you all to understand, fully and surely,
      that no wrong is intended to you! The man whom we have loved,&mdash;the
      man who has served us faithfully as Pasquin Leroy,&mdash;is still the same
      man, though the King! Rank cannot alter his proved friendship and service,&mdash;nor
      kingship break his bond! He is one of us,&mdash;signed and sealed in the
      blood of Lotys;&mdash;and as one of us he must, and will remain! Have I
      spoken truly?" he added, turning to the King, "or is there more that I
      should say?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Before any reply could be given a hubbub of voices cried:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Explain! Confess! Bind him to his oath!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Whereat the King, stepping forward a pace or two, confronted his would-be
      doubters and detractors with a dauntless composure.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Explain? Confess? Friends, I will do both! but for binding me to my oath,
      there is no need,&mdash;for it is too strong a compact of faith and
      friendship ever to be broken! Would you have me remind <i>you</i> of your
      Vow of Fealty pronounced so solemnly this evening? Did you not swear that
      'Whosoever among us this night shall draw the Red Cross Signal which
      destines him to take from life a life proved unworthy, shall be to us a
      sacred person, and an object of defence and continued protection'? As
      Pasquin Leroy, this vow applied to me,&mdash;as King, I ask no better or
      stronger pledge of loyalty!"
    </p>
    <p>
      All eyes were fixed upon him as he spoke. For some moments there was a
      dead silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      This silence was presently broken by a murmur of conflicting wonder,
      impatience and uncertainty,&mdash;deepening as it ran,&mdash;and then,&mdash;as
      the full situation became more and more apparent, coupled with the smiling
      and heroic calm of the monarch who had thus placed himself voluntarily in
      the hands of his sworn enemies, all their struggling passions were
      suddenly merged in one great wave of natural and human admiration for a
      brave man and a burst of impetuous cheering broke impulsively from every
      lip. Once started, the infection caught on like a fever,&mdash;and again
      and yet again the excited Revolutionists cheered 'for the King!'&mdash;till
      they made the room echo.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tumult was extraordinary. Lotys sat silent, with clasped hands, her
      eyes dilated with feverish watchfulness and excitement,&mdash;the tempest
      of emotion in her own poor tortured soul, being of such a character which
      no words, no tears, no exclamations could possibly relieve. The memory of
      her interview with the King in his own Palace flashed across her like a
      scene limned in fire. She had no power to think&mdash;she was simply
      stunned and overwhelmed,&mdash;and held only one idea in her mind, and
      that was to save him at all costs, even at the sacrifice of her own life.
      Thord, carried away from his very self by the force of such a 'Revolution'
      as he had never planned or anticipated, stood more in the attitude of one
      who was trying to think, rather than of one who was thinking.
    </p>
    <p>
      "For the King!" cried Johan Zegota, suddenly giving vent to the feelings
      he had long kept in check,&mdash;feelings which had made him a greater
      admirer of the so-called "Pasquin Leroy" than of Thord himself;&mdash;"For
      our sworn comrade, the King!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Again the cheers broke out, to be redoubled in intensity when Louis Valdor
      added his voice to the rest and exclaimed:
    </p>
    <p>
      "For the first real King I have ever known!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the excitement rose to its zenith,&mdash;and amidst the tempest of
      applause, the King himself stood quiet, watching the turbulence with the
      thoughtful eyes of a student who seeks to unravel some difficult problem.
      Raising his hand gently, he, by this gesture created immediate silence,&mdash;and
      so, in this hush remained for an instant, leaning slightly against the
      Committee Table, draped as it was in its funereal black,&mdash;the lights
      at either end of it, and the red lamp in its centre flinging an unearthly
      radiance on his fine composed features. Long, long afterwards, his
      faithful servants, Sir Roger de Launay and Heinrich von Glauben retained a
      mental picture of him in that attitude,&mdash;the dauntless smile upon his
      lips,&mdash;the dreamful look in his eyes,&mdash;resting, as it seemed
      against a prepared funeral-bier, with the watch-lights burning for burial,&mdash;and
      the face of Lotys, pale as a marble mask, yet wearing an expression of
      mingled triumph and agony, shining near him like a star amid the gloom,
      while the tall form of Sergius Thord in the background loomed large,&mdash;a
      shadow of impending evil.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a pause, he spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Comrades! I thank you for the expressed renewal of your trust in me. In
      my heart and soul, as a man, I am one of you and with you;&mdash;even
      though fate has made me a king! You demand an explanation&mdash;a
      confession. You shall have both! When I enrolled myself as a member of
      your Committee, I did so in all honesty and honour,&mdash;wishing to
      discover the object of your Cause, and prepared to aid it if I found it
      worthy. When I sealed my compact with you in the blood of Lotys, the Angel
      of our Covenant,"&mdash;here the cheering again broke out,&mdash;and
      Lotys, turning aside, endeavoured to restrain the tears that threatened to
      fall;&mdash;then, as silence was restored, he resumed;&mdash;"When as I
      say, I did this,&mdash;you will remember that on being asked of my origin
      and country, I answered that I was a slave. I spoke truly! There is no
      greater slave in all the length and breadth of the world than a king!
      Bound by the chains of convention and custom, he is coerced more violently
      than any prisoner,&mdash;his lightest word is misunderstood&mdash;his
      smallest action is misconstrued,&mdash;his very looks are made the subject
      of comment&mdash;and whether he walks or stands,&mdash;sits to give
      wearisome audience, or lies down to forget his sorrows in sleep, he should
      assuredly be an object of the deepest pity and consideration, instead of
      being as he often is, a target for the arrows of slander,&mdash;a pivot
      round which to move the wheel of social evil and misrule! The name of
      Freedom sounds sweet in your ears, my friends!&mdash;how sweet it is&mdash;how
      dear it is, we all know! You are ready to fight for it&mdash;to die for
      it! Then remember, all of you, that it is a glory utterly unknown to a
      king! Were he to take sword in hand and do battle for it unto the death,
      he could never obtain it;&mdash;he might win it for his country, but never
      for himself! Nothing so glorious as Liberty!&mdash;you cry! True!&mdash;but
      kings are prisoners from the moment they ascend thrones! And you never set
      them free, save in the way you suggested this evening;" and he smiled,
      "which way is still open to you&mdash;and&mdash;to me! But while you take
      time to consider whether I shall or shall not fulfil the duty which the
      drawing of lots on this Day of Fate has assigned to me,&mdash;whether you,
      on your parts, will or will not maintain the Vow of Fealty which we all
      have sworn together,&mdash;I will freely declare to you the motives which
      led me to depart from the conventional rule and formality of a merely
      'Royal' existence, and to become as a Man among men,&mdash;for once at
      least in the history of modern sovereigns!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He paused,&mdash;every eye was fixed upon him; and the stillness was so
      intense that the lightest breath might be heard.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I came to the Throne three years ago," he resumed, "and I accepted its
      responsibilities with reluctance. As Heir-Apparent, you all know, or think
      you know, my career; for some of you have very freely expressed your
      convictions concerning it! It was discreditable,&mdash;according to the
      opinions formed and expressed by this Committee. No doubt it was! Let any
      man among you occupy my place;&mdash;and be surrounded by the same
      temptations,&mdash;and then comport himself wisely&mdash;if he can! Such
      an one would need to be either god or hero; and I profess to be neither.
      But I do not wish to palliate or deny the errors of the past. The present
      is my concern,&mdash;the present time, and the present People. Great
      changes are fermenting in the world; and of these changes, especially of
      those directly affecting our own country, I became actively conscious,
      shortly after I ascended the Throne. I heard of disaffections,&mdash;disloyalties;
      I gathered that the Ministry were suspected of personal
      self-aggrandisement. I learned that a disastrous policy was on foot
      respecting National Education&mdash;in which priestcraft would be given
      every advantage, and Jesuitry obtain undue influence over the minds of the
      rising generation. I heard,&mdash;I studied,&mdash;and finding that I
      could get no true answer on any point at issue from anyone of my supposed
      'reliable' ministers, I resolved to discover things for myself. I found
      out that the disaffected portion of the metropolis was chiefly under the
      influence of Sergius Thord&mdash;and accordingly I placed myself in his
      way, and became enrolled among you as 'Pasquin Leroy'; his sworn
      associate. I am his sworn associate still! I am proud that he should call
      me friend;&mdash;and even as we have worked already for the People, so we
      will work still&mdash;together!"
    </p>
    <p>
      No restraint could have availed to check the wild plaudits that broke out
      afresh at these words. Still thoughtfully and with grave kindness
      contemplating all the eager and excited faces upturned to him, the King
      went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You know nearly all the rest. As Pasquin Leroy, I discovered all the
      shameful speculations with the public money, carried on by Carl Pérousse,&mdash;and
      found that so far, at any rate, your accusations against him were founded
      in fact. At the first threatening suspicion of possible condemnation the
      Marquis de Lutera resigned,&mdash;thus evidencing his guilty participation
      in the intended plunder. A false statement printed by David Jost, stating
      that I,&mdash;the King,&mdash;had revoked my decision concerning the
      refusal of land to the Jesuits, caused me to announce the truth of my own
      action myself, in the rival newspaper. Of my excommunication from the
      Church it is unnecessary to speak; a man is not injured in God's sight by
      that merely earthly ban. Among other things"&mdash;and he smiled,&mdash;"I
      found myself curiously possessed of a taste for literature!&mdash;and
      proved, that whereas some few monarchs of my acquaintance cannot be quite
      sure of their spelling, I could, at a pinch, make myself fairly well
      understood by the general public, as a skilled writer of polemics against
      myself!&mdash;as well as against the Secretary of State. This, so far as I
      personally am concerned, has been the humorous side of my little drama of
      disguise!&mdash;for sometimes I have had serious thoughts of appearing as
      a rival to our friend, Paul Zouche, in the lists of literary Fame!"
    </p>
    <p>
      A murmur of wondering laughter ran round the room,&mdash;and all heads
      were turned to one corner, as the King, with the kindly smile still
      lighting up his eyes and lips, called:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Zouche, are you there? Do you hear me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Zouche did hear. He had been sitting in a state of semi-stupor all the
      evening,&mdash;his chaotic mind utterly confused and bewildered by the
      events which had taken place;&mdash;but now, on being called, his usual
      audacious and irrepressible spirit came to his aid, and he answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      "O King, I hear! O King, your Majesty would make the deaf to hear, and the
      dumb to speak! And if there is anything to be done to me for abominating
      you, O King, who had the impudence to offer me a hundred gold pieces a
      year for my poems, I, O King, will submit to the utmost terrors of the
      law!"
    </p>
    <p>
      A burst of laughter long and loud, relieved the pent-up feelings of the
      company. The King laughed as heartily as the rest, and over the brooding
      features of Thord himself came the shadow of a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We will settle our accounts together later on, Zouche!" said the monarch
      gaily; "Meanwhile, I beg you to continue your harmless abomination of me
      at your leisure!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Another laugh went round, and then the King resuming his speech continued:
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have played two parts at once,&mdash;Revolutionist and King! But both
      parts are after all but two sides of the same nature. When I first came
      among you, I bade you all look at me well,&mdash;I asked you to note the
      resemblance I bore to the ruling Sovereign. I called myself 'the living
      copy of the man I most despise.' That was quite true! For there is no one
      I despise more utterly than myself,&mdash;when I think what I might have
      done with my million opportunities, and how much time I have wasted! You
      all scrutinised me closely;&mdash;and I did not flinch! You all accepted
      my service,&mdash;and I have served you well! I have noted every one of
      your desires. Where possible, I have sought to fulfil them. Every
      accusation you have brought against the Ministry has been sifted to the
      bottom, and proved down to the hilt. My publicly-proclaimed decision to
      nominate Carl Pérousse as Premier was merely thrown out as a test to try
      the temper and quality of the nation. That test has answered its purpose
      well! But there is no need for fear,&mdash;Carl Pérousse will never be
      nominated to anything but disgrace! All his schemes are in my hand,&mdash;I
      hold complete documentary proofs of his dishonesty and guilt; and the very
      day which you have chosen as that on which to appeal to the King against
      the choice of him as Prime Minister, will see him denounced by myself in
      person to the Government."
    </p>
    <p>
      A storm of applause greeted this welcome announcement. For a moment all
      the men went mad with excitement, shouting, stamping and singing,&mdash;while
      again and yet again the cry: 'For the King!' echoed round and round in
      tempestuous cheering.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sergius Thord gazed blankly at the Scene with a strange sense of being the
      dreaming witness of some marvellous drama enacted altogether away from the
      earth. He could hot yet bring himself to realise that by such a simple
      method as the independent working of one individual intelligence, all his
      own followers had been swept round to loyalty and love for a monarch, whom
      previously, though without knowing him, they had hated&mdash;and sworn to
      destroy! Yet, in very truth, all the hatreds and envys,&mdash;all the
      slanders and cruelties of the members of the human race towards each
      other, spring from ignorance; and when disaffected persons hate a king,
      they do so mostly because they do not know him, and because they can form
      no true opinion of his qualities or the various difficulties of his
      position. If the Anarchist, bent on the destruction of some person in
      authority, only had the culture and knowledge to recognise how much that
      person already suffers, by being in all probability forced to fulfil
      duties for which he has no heart or mind, he would stay his murderous
      hand, and pity rather than condemn. For the removal of one ruler only
      means the installation of another,&mdash;and the wild and often gifted
      souls of reformers, stumbling through darkness after some great Ideal
      which resolves itself into a shadow and delusion the nearer one approaches
      to it, need to be tenderly dealt with from the standpoint of plainest
      simplicity and truth,&mdash;so that they may feel the sympathetic touch of
      human love and care emanating from those very quarters which they seek to
      assail. This had been the self-imposed mission of the King who had played
      the part of 'Pasquin Leroy';&mdash;and thus, fearing nothing, doubting
      nothing, and relying simply on his own strength, discretion, and
      determination, he had gained a moral victory over the passions of his
      secret foes such as he had never himself anticipated. When silence was
      again restored, he proceeded:
    </p>
    <p>
      "The various suggestions made in my presence during the time I have been a
      member of this Committee, will all be carried out. The present Government
      will naturally oppose every measure,&mdash;but I,&mdash;backed by such
      supporters as I have now won,&mdash;will elect a new Government&mdash;a
      new Ministry. When I began this bloodless campaign of my own, the present
      Ministry were on the edge of war. Determined to provoke hostilities with a
      peaceful Power, they were ready even with arms and ammunition,
      manufactured by a 'Company,' of which Pérousse was the director and chief
      shareholder! Contracts for army supplies were being secretly tendered; and
      one was already secretly accepted and arranged for,&mdash;in which Carl
      Pérousse and the Marquis de Lutera were to derive enormous interest;&mdash;the
      head of the concern being David Jost. This plan was concocted with
      devilish ingenuity,&mdash;for, if the war had actually broken out, the
      supplies of our army would have been of the worst possible kind, in order
      to give the best possible profit to the contractors; and Jost, with his
      newspaper influence, would have satisfied the public mind by printing
      constant reiterations of the completeness and excellence of the supplies,
      and the entire contentment and jubilation of the men! But I awoke to my
      responsibilities in time to checkmate this move. I forbade the provocation
      intended;&mdash;I stopped the war. In this matter at least&mdash;much loss
      of life, much heavy expenditure, and much ill-will among other nations has
      been happily spared to us. For the rest,&mdash;everything you have been
      working for shall be granted,&mdash;if you yourselves will help me to
      realise your own plans! I want you in your thousands!&mdash;ay, in your
      tens of thousands! I want you all on my side! With you,&mdash;the
      representatives of the otherwise unvoiced People,&mdash;I will enforce all
      the measures which you have discussed before me, showing good and adequate
      reason why they should be carried. The taxes you complain of shall be
      instantly removed;&mdash;and for the more speedy replenishment of the
      National Exchequer, I gladly resign one half my revenues from all sources
      whatsoever for the space of five years; or longer, if considered
      desirable. But I want your aid! Will you all stand by me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      A mighty shout answered him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "To the death!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned to Thord.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sergius," he said, "my task is finished&mdash;my confession made! The
      next Order of this meeting must come from you!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Thord looked at him amazedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "From me? Are you not the King?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Only so long as the People desire it!" replied the monarch gently; "And
      are you not the representative of the People?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Thord's chest heaved. Burning tears stood in his eyes. The strangeness of
      the situation&mdash;the deliberate coolness and resolve with which this
      sovereign ruler of a powerful kingdom laid his life trustingly in his
      hands, was too much for his nerve.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lotys!" he said huskily; "Lotys!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She rose at once and came to him, moving ghostlike in her white draperies,
      her eyes shining&mdash;her lips tremulous.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lotys," he said, "The King is in our hands! You saved his life once&mdash;will
      you save it again?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She raised her bent head, and the old courageous light flashed in her
      face, transfiguring its every feature.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is not for me to save!" she replied in clear firm tones; "It is for
      you&mdash;and for all of us,&mdash;to defend!"
    </p>
    <p>
      A ringing cheer answered her. Sergius Thord slowly advanced, and as he did
      so, the King, seeing his movement frankly held out his hand. For a moment
      the Socialist Chief hesitated&mdash;then suddenly yielding to his
      overpowering impulse, caught that hand and raised his dark eyes full to
      the monarch's face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have conquered me!" he said, "But only by your qualities as a man&mdash;not
      by your authority as a king! You have won my honour&mdash;my respect&mdash;my
      gratitude&mdash;my friendship&mdash;and with these, so long as you are
      faithful to our Cause, take my allegiance! More I cannot say&mdash;more I
      will not promise!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I need no more!" responded the King cheerily, enclosing his hand in a
      warm clasp. "We are friends and fellow-workers, Sergius!&mdash;we can
      never be rivals!"
    </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke, his glance fell on Lotys. She shrank from the swift passion
      of his gaze,&mdash;and her eyelids drooped half-swooningly over the bright
      star-windows of her own too ardent soul. Abruptly turning from both her
      and Thord, the King again addressed the company:
    </p>
    <p>
      "One word more, my friends! It is arranged that you, with all your
      thousands of the People are to convene together in one great multitude,
      and march to the Palace to demand justice from the King. There is now no
      need to do this,&mdash;for the King himself is one of you!&mdash;the King
      only lives and reigns that justice in all respects may be done! I will
      therefore ask you to change your plan;&mdash;and instead of marching to
      the Palace, march with me to the House of Government. You would have
      demanded justice from the King; the King himself will go with you to
      demand justice for the People!"
    </p>
    <p>
      A wild shout answered him; and he knew as he looked on the faces of his
      hearers that he had them all in his power as the servants of his will.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And now, gentlemen," he proceeded; "I should perhaps make some excuses
      for my two friends, known to you as Max Graub and Axel Regor. I told you I
      would be responsible for their conduct, and, so far as they have been
      permitted to go, they have behaved well! I must, however, in justice to
      them, assure you that whereas I became a member of your Committee gladly,
      they followed my example reluctantly, and only out of fidelity and
      obedience to me. They have lived in the shadow of the Throne,&mdash;and
      have learned to pity,&mdash;and I think,&mdash;to love its occupant!
      Because they know,&mdash;as you have never known,&mdash;the heavy burden
      which a king puts on with his crown! They have, however, in their way,
      served you under my orders, and under my orders will continue to serve you
      still. Max Graub, or, to give him his right name, Heinrich von Glauben,
      has a high reputation in this country for his learning, apart from his
      position as Household Physician to our Court;&mdash;Axel Regor is my very
      good friend Sir Roger de Launay, who is amiable enough to support the
      monotony of his duty as one of my equerries in waiting. Now you know us as
      we are! But after all, nothing is changed, save our names and the titles
      we bear; we are the same men, the same friends, the same comrades!&mdash;and
      so I trust we shall remain!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The cheering broke out again, and Sir Roger de Launay, who was quite as
      overwhelmed with astonishment at the courage and coolness of his Royal
      master as any Revolutionist present, joined in it with a will, as did Von
      Glauben.
    </p>
    <p>
      "One favour I have to ask of you," proceeded the King, "and it is this: If
      you exempt me to-night from killing the King;" and he smiled,&mdash;"you
      must also exempt all the members of the Revolutionary Committee from any
      similar task allotted to them by having drawn the fatal Signal! Our
      friend, Zouche, for instance, has drawn the name of Carl Pérousse. Now I
      want Zouche for better work than that of killing a rascal!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Loud cheers answered him, and Zouche rising from his place advanced a
      little.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Majesty!" he cried, "You are right! I hand your Majesty's intended
      Premier over to you with the greatest, pleasure in the world! Apart from
      the fact of your being the King, I am compelled to admit that you have
      common sense!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Laughter and cheers resounded through the room again, and the King quietly
      turning round, extinguished the red lamp on the table. The thirteenth
      light was quenched; the Day of Fate was ended. As the ominous crimson
      flare sank out, a sudden silence prevailed, and the King fixed his eyes on
      Lotys.
    </p>
    <p>
      "From you, Madame, must come my final exoneration! If you still condemn me
      as a King, I shall be indeed unfortunate! If you still think well of me as
      a man, I shall be proud! I have to thank you, not only for my life, but
      for having helped me to make that life valuable! As Pasquin Leroy, I have
      sought to serve you,&mdash;as King, I seek to serve you still!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The silence continued. Every man present watched the visible emotion which
      swept every vestige of colour from the face of Lotys, and made her eyes so
      feverishly bright. Every man gazed at her as she rose from her chair and
      came forward a little to the front of the platform. It was with a strong
      effort that she raised her eyes to those of the King, and in that one
      glance between them, the lightning flash of a resistless love tore the
      veil of secrecy from their souls. But she spoke out bravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thank your Majesty!" she said; "I thank you for all you have done for
      us as our comrade and associate,&mdash;for all you will yet do for us as
      our comrade and associate still! It is better to be a brave man than a
      weak King&mdash;but it is best to be a strong man and a strong king both
      together! You have disproved the thoughts I had of you as King! You have
      ratified&mdash;" here she paused, while the colour suddenly sprang to her
      cheeks, and her breath came pantingly and quick,&mdash;"and strengthened
      the thoughts I had of you as our Pasquin!" Her eyes softened with tears,
      though she smiled. "We have believed in you; we believe in you still! All
      is as it was,&mdash;save in the one thing new,&mdash;that where we were
      banded together against the King, we are now united for, and with the
      King!"
    </p>
    <p>
      These words were all that were needed to reawaken and confirm the
      enthusiasm of the Revolutionists, whose 'revolutionary' measures were now
      accepted and sworn to by the Crowned Head of the Realm. Thereupon, they
      gave themselves up to the wildest cheering.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Comrades!" cried Paul Zouche, in the midst of the uproar; "There is one
      point you seem to have missed! The King,&mdash;God bless him!&mdash;doesn't
      see it,&mdash;Thord, glowering like an owl in his ivy-bush of hair,
      doesn't see it! It is only left to me to perceive the chief result of this
      evening's disclosures!"
    </p>
    <p>
      All the men laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is it, Zouche?" demanded Louis Valdor.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ay! What is it?" echoed Zegota.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Speak, Zouche!" said the King; "Whatever strange conclusion your poetic
      brain discovers, doubt not but that we shall accept it,&mdash;from!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Accept it? I should think so!" cried Zouche; "You are bound to accept it
      whether you like it or not; there is no other way out of it!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, what is it?" repeated Zegota impatiently; "Declare it!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is this;" said Zouche, "Simply this,&mdash;that, with the King as our
      comrade and associate, the Revolutionary Committee is no use! It is
      finished! There can be no longer a Revolutionary Committee!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is true!" said the King; "It may henceforth be known as a new
      Parliament!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Cheer after cheer echoed through the crowded room, and while the noise was
      at its height a knocking was heard outside and Sholto, the hunchback
      father of Pequita, demanded admittance. Zegota unlocked the door, and in a
      few minutes the situation was explained to the astonished landlord of the
      Revolutionary Committee quarters. Overwhelmed at the news, and full of
      gratitude for the kindness shown to his child, which he now knew had
      emanated from the King in person, he would have knelt to kiss the Royal
      hand, had not the monarch prevented him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, my good Sholto!" he said gently; "Enough of such humility wearies me
      in the monotonous routine of Court life; and were it not for custom and
      prejudice, I would suffer no self-respecting man to abase himself before
      me, simply because my profession is that of King! Tell Pequita that I
      would not look at her, or applaud her dancing the other night, because I
      wished her to hate the King and to love Pasquin!&mdash;but now you must
      ask her for me, to love them both!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Sholto bowed low, profoundly overcome. Was this the King against whom they
      had all been in league?&mdash;this simple, unaffected man, who seemed so
      much at home and at one with them all? Amazed and bewildered, he, by
      general invitation, mixed with the rest of the men, for each of whom the
      King had a kind and appreciative word, or a fresh pledge of his good faith
      and intention towards them and the reforms they sought to effect. Von
      Glauben was surrounded by a group of those among whom he had made himself
      popular; and a hundred eager questions were asked of both him and De
      Launay, who were ready enough to eulogise the daring of their Royal
      master, and the determination with which he had resolved on making his
      secret foes his open friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      "After all," said Zegota deprecatingly, "it is not so much the King whom
      we were against, as the Government."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah! You forget, no doubt," said Von Glauben, "that the King&mdash;any
      King&mdash;is usually a Dummy in the hands of Government, unless, as in
      the present instance, he chooses to become a living Personality for
      himself!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The King has created an autocracy!" said Louis Valdor; "and it will last
      for his lifetime. But after&mdash;&mdash;!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "After him,&mdash;if his eldest son, Prince Humphry, comes to the Throne,&mdash;the
      autocracy will be continued;" said Von Glauben decisively; "For he is a
      young man who is singularly fond of having his own way!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The conversation now became general; and the big, bare, common room
      assumed in a few minutes almost the aspect of a Royal levée. This was
      curious enough,&mdash;and furnished food for meditation to Professor von
      Glauben, who was considerably excited by the dramatic dénouement of the
      Day of Fate,&mdash;a climax for which neither he nor Sir Roger had been in
      the least prepared. He said something of it to Sir Roger who was watching
      Lotys.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You look at the woman," he said; "I look at the man! Do you think this
      drama is finished?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not yet!" answered De Launay curtly; "Nor is the danger over!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The hum of talk continued; and the good feeling of friendship and unity of
      the assemblage was intensified with every cordial handshake. When the time
      came to break up, someone suggested that a carriage should be sent for to
      convey the King and his two companions to the Palace. Whereat the monarch
      laughed aloud and right joyously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "By my faith!" he exclaimed; "You, my friends, would actually pamper me
      already, by offering me a luxury which you yourselves do not propose to
      enjoy! Ah, my friends, here comes in the mischief of the monarchical
      system! What of your 'Liberty, Equality, and Fraternity'? Do I ask to have
      anything different to yourselves? Can I not walk, even as you do? Have I
      not walked to, and from these meetings often? And even so, I purpose to
      walk now! If you are true Revolutionists&mdash;as I am&mdash;do not
      reverse your own theories! You complain,&mdash;and justly,&mdash;that a
      king is over-flattered; do not then flatter him yourselves by insisting on
      such convenience for him as he does not even demand at your hands!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You take us too literally, Sir," said Louis Valdor; "Even Revolutionists
      owe respect to their chief!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sergius Thord is your Chief, my friend!" replied the monarch; "And, from
      a Revolutionary point of view, mine! But you have never thought of sending
      <i>him</i> anywhere in a carriage! Ah!&mdash;what children we are! What
      slaves of convention! 'Liberty, Equality and Fraternity' have been the
      ideals of ages;&mdash;yet despite them, we are always ready to follow a
      Leader,&mdash;and form ourselves into one body under a Head!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Provided the Head has brains in it!" said Zouche. "But otherwise&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You cut it off!" laughed the monarch&mdash;"and quite right too!"
    </p>
    <p>
      They now began to separate. The hunchback Sholto explained that it was
      long after midnight, and that he had already put out all the lights in the
      basement.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whereupon the King, turning to Sergius Thord said: "Farewell for the
      moment, Sergius! Come to me at the Palace with the whole plan of the
      meeting you are now organising; I shall hold myself ready to fall in with
      your plans! Gather your thousands, and&mdash;leave the rest to me!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Thord clasped his extended hand,&mdash;and was moved by a curious instinct
      to bend down low over it after the fashion of a courtier, but restrained
      himself almost by force. The men began to move; one after the other bade
      good-night to the King&mdash;then to Thord, and last to Lotys, who,
      drawing on her cloak, prepared to leave also.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will see you safely down the stairs," said the King smilingly, to her.
      "It is not the first time I have done so! How now, Zouche?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Paul Zouche stood before him, his eyes full of a strange mingled pathos
      and scorn.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have to thank your Majesty," he said slowly, "for something I do not in
      the least value,&mdash;Fame! It has come too late! Had it been my portion
      three years ago, the woman I loved would have been proud of me, and I
      should have been happy! She is dead now&mdash;and nothing matters!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The King was silent. There was something both solemn and pitiful about
      this wreck of manhood which was still kept alive by the fire of genius.
    </p>
    <p>
      "With one word you might have saved me&mdash;and her!" he went on. "When
      you came to the Throne,&mdash;and all the wretched versifiers in the
      kingdom were scribbling twaddle in the way of 'Coronation odes' and
      medleys, I wrote 'The Song of Freedom' for your glory! All the people of
      the land know that song now!&mdash;but you might have known it then! For
      now it is too late!&mdash;too late to call her back;&mdash;too late to
      give me peace!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He paused;&mdash;then&mdash;without another word&mdash;turned, and went
      out.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Poor Zouche!" said the King gently; "I accept his reproach and understand
      it! He is right! The recognition of his genius is one of the thousand
      chances I have missed! But, as God lives, I will miss no more!"
    </p>
    <p>
      A great quietude fell on the house as the Revolutionary Committee
      dispersed. The last to leave was the King, his two friends, and Lotys.
      Lotys declined all escort somewhat imperatively, refusing to allow Sergius
      Thord to see her to her own home.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I must be alone!" she said; "Do you not understand! I want to think&mdash;I
      want to realise our change of position. I cannot talk to you, Sergius,&mdash;no&mdash;not
      till to-morrow&mdash;you must let me be!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He drew back, chilled and hurt by her tone, but forbore to press his
      company on her. With another farewell to the King, he stood at the top of
      the long dark winding stair watching the group descend,&mdash;first Von
      Glauben, next De Launay,&mdash;thirdly, the King,&mdash;and lastly, Lotys.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good-night!" he called, as her white robes vanished in the gloom.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good-night!" she answered tremulously, as she disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      And he, returning to the empty room, stared vacantly at the table draped
      with black, and the funeral urn set upon it,&mdash;stared at the empty
      chairs and bare walls, and listened as it were, to the midnight silence,&mdash;realising
      that he as Chief of the Revolutionary Committee, was no longer a chief but
      a servant!&mdash;and that the power he sought&mdash;that power which he
      had endeavoured to attain in order that he might make of Lotys, as he had
      said, 'a queen among women!' was only to be won through,&mdash;the King!
      The King knew all his secret plans and his aims,&mdash;he held the clue to
      the whole network of his Revolutionary organisation,&mdash;and the only
      chance he now had of ever arriving at the highest goal of his ambition was
      in the King's hands! Thus was he,&mdash;Socialist and Revolutionist,&mdash;made
      subject to the Throne; the very rules he had drawn up for himself and his
      Committee making it impossible that he could be otherwise than loyal, to a
      monarch who was at the same time his comrade!
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, in the thick darkness of the hall below, while Von Glauben and
      De Launay were groping their way to the door which was cautiously held
      open by Sholto, Lotys, moving with hesitating steps down the stairs, felt
      rather than saw a head turned back upon her,&mdash;a flash of eyes in the
      darkness, and heard her name breathed softly:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lotys!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She grew dizzy and uncertain of her footing; she could not answer.
      Suddenly a strong arm caught her,&mdash;she was drawn into a close,
      fierce, jealous clasp; warm lips caressed her hair, her brow, her eyes;
      and a voice whispered in her ear:
    </p>
    <p>
      "You love me, Lotys! You love me! Hush!&mdash;do not deny it&mdash;you
      cannot deny it!&mdash;you know it, as I know it!&mdash;you have told me
      you love me! You love me, my Love! You love me!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Another moment&mdash;and the King passed quietly out of the door with a
      bland 'Good-night' to Sholto, and joining his two companions, raised his
      hat to Lotys with a courteous salutation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good-night, Madame!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She stood in the doorway, shuddering violently from head to foot,&mdash;watching
      his tall figure disappear in the shadows of the street. Then stretching
      out her hands blindly, she gave a faint cry, and murmuring something
      inarticulate to the alarmed Sholto, fell senseless at his feet.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXX. &mdash; KING AND SOCIALIST
    </h2>
    <p>
      To many persons of the servile or flunkey habit, the idea that a king
      should ever comport himself as an ordinary,&mdash;or extraordinary,&mdash;man,
      seems more or less preposterous; while to conceive him as endowed with
      dash, spirit, and a love of adventure is judged almost as absurd and
      impossible. The only potentate that ever appears, in legendary lore, to
      have indulged himself to his heart's content in the sport of adopting a
      disguise and going about unrecognised among his subjects, is the witty and
      delightful hero of the 'Arabian Nights' Entertainment,' Caliph Haroun
      Alraschid, who, as Tennyson describes him, had
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  "Deep eyes, laughter-stirred
  With merriment of kingly pride;
  Sole star of all that place and time,
  I saw him in his golden prime.
  The good Haroun Alraschid!"
</pre>
    <p>
      We accept Haroun; and acknowledge him to have been wise in the purport of
      his wanderings through the streets of the city,&mdash;gaining new
      experience with every hour, and studying the needs and complaints of his
      people for himself;&mdash;but if we should be told of a modern monarch
      doing likewise in our own day, we should mount on the stiff hobby-horse of
      our ridiculous conventionality, and accuse him of having brought the
      dignity of the Throne into contempt. Yet nothing perhaps can be more
      contemptible than a monarch who is too surrounded by flunkeyism to be a
      Man,&mdash;and, on the other hand, nothing could be more beneficial than
      the feeling that perhaps a monarch may be so much of a man after all that
      no one can be quite certain as to his whereabouts. It would be well if
      some rowdy 'clubs' could be restrained by the idea that the Sovereign of
      the Realm might step in unexpectedly,&mdash;or if the 'slums' could
      scarcely be able to tell when he might not be among their inmates,
      disguised as one of them, studying and knowing more in a day than his
      ministers would tell him in several years. It is generally admitted that
      no man is fit for a profession till he has thoroughly mastered its
      possibilities,&mdash;yet it is not too much to declare that in the
      profession of Sovereignty the few who practise it, have mastered it to so
      little purpose, that they are almost entirely blind to the singular
      advantages which they might obtain, not only for themselves, but for the
      entire world, if they chose to put forth their own individuality, and,
      instead of wasting their time on the scheming and self-seeking sections of
      Society, elected to try their powers on the working and trade communities
      of the nation. But throughout all history, the various careers of kings
      and emperors contain instructive lessons of Lost Opportunity. Allowing for
      the differences of climate and temperament, it may be taken for granted
      that no people of any country are constitutionally able to rise above a
      certain height of enthusiasm; and that when the high-water mark is
      reached, their enthusiasm cools, and a reaction invariably sets in. For
      this cause a monarch should never rely too much on the plaudits of the mob
      in a time of conquest, or public festival of jubilation. He should look
      upon such acclamation as the mere rising of a wave, which must in due time
      sink again,&mdash;and if he would know his people thoroughly, he should
      study that same shouting mob, not when it is affected by hysteria, but
      during its everyday level condition of stubborn and patient toil. So will
      he perhaps be able to lay his finger on the sore places of life, and to
      find out where the seed of mischief is planted, before it begins to grow.
      But he must give an individual interest to such work; no information must
      be obtained or given through this person or that person,&mdash;for the old
      maxim that 'if you want anything done, do it yourself' applies to kings as
      well as to all other classes of men.
    </p>
    <p>
      That the old adage had been amply practised by one king at least, was soon
      known throughout the capital of the country over which the monarch here
      written of held dominion. Somehow, and by some means or other, the story
      oozed out bit by bit and in guarded whispers, that the King had 'trapped'
      Carl Pérousse, as well as several other defaulting ministers,&mdash;and
      that, strange and incredible as it appeared, he himself was the very
      'Pasquin Leroy' whose political polemics had created such a stir. Once
      started, the rumour flew;&mdash;some disbelieved it;&mdash;others
      listened, with ears stretched wide, greedy for more detail,&mdash;but
      presently the scattered threads of gossip became woven into a consecutive
      web of certainty so far as one point, at least, was concerned,&mdash;and
      this was, that the King would personally address his Parliament during the
      ensuing week on matters of national safety and importance. Such an
      announcement was altogether unprecedented, and excited the whole country's
      attention. Plenty of discussion there was, as to whether the King had any
      right to so address the members of the Government,&mdash;and some oracular
      journals were of the opinion that he was acting in an 'unconstitutional
      manner.' On the other hand, it was discovered and proved that there was no
      actual law forbidding the Sovereign to speak when any question of urgency
      appeared to call for his expressed opinion.
    </p>
    <p>
      While this affair was being contested and argued, a considerable sensation
      was created by the news that the Marquis de Lutera had suddenly left the
      country,&mdash;ostensibly for his health, which, everyone was assured, had
      completely broken down. People shook their heads ominously, and wondered
      when the King would give M. Pérousse the task of forming a new Ministry,&mdash;while
      they watched with deepening interest the progress of the various
      Government debates, which were carried on in the usual way, following the
      lines laid down by the absent Premier, Marquis de Lutera. Carl Pérousse,
      confronted by a thousand difficulties, maintained his usual equable and
      audacious attitude, scouting with scorn the rumour that the Socialist
      writer, 'Pasquin Leroy' was merely a disguise adopted by the King himself,&mdash;and
      he was as cool and imperturbable as ever when one morning David Jost
      succeeded in finding him at home, and obtaining an audience.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was the King!" burst out Jost, as soon as he found himself alone with
      his ally; "It was the King himself who wore Lutera's signet, and came to
      me disguised so well that his own father would not have known him! The
      King himself, I say! And I told him everything!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "More fool you!" returned Pérousse quietly; "However, fools generally have
      to pay the price of their folly!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And knaves!" said Jost furiously; "But there is a power which cannot be
      controlled, even by kings or statesmen&mdash;and that is&mdash;the pen!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And do you think you can use the pen?" queried Pérousse indolently;
      "Excellent Shylock, you know you cannot! You can pay others to use it for
      you! That is all!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can make short work of <i>you</i> at any rate!" said Jost, his little
      eyes sparkling with rage; "For I see plainly enough now that even if our
      plans had succeeded, you would have left me in the lurch!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course!" smiled Pérousse; "Are you so simple in the world's ways as
      not to be able to realise that such Jew pressmen as you are only made for
      the use of politicians? We drop you, when we have done with you! Go to
      London, Jost! Start a paper there! It is the very place for you! Get a
      Cardinal to back you up, with funds to be used for the 'conversion' of
      England! Or give a hundred thousand pounds to a hospital! You can become
      naturalised as an Englishman if you like; any country does for a Jew! And
      you will be a power of the realm in no time! They manage these sort of
      things capitally there!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "By God!" said Jost; "I could kill you!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What for?" demanded Pérousse; "Because you think I am going to be proved
      a political fraud? Wait and see! If the King denounces me, I am prepared
      to denounce the King!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Jost stared, then laughed aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Denounce the King! You are bold! But you make up your sum with the wrong
      numerals this time! The King holds the complete list of your speculations
      in his hand,&mdash;he has got them through the agency of the Revolutionary
      Committee, to which your stockbroker's confidential clerk belongs! You
      fool! All your schemes&mdash;all your 'companies' are known to him root
      and branch&mdash;and you say you will 'denounce' him! If you do, it will
      be a real comedy!&mdash;the case of a thief denouncing the officer who has
      caught him red-handed in the act of thieving!"
    </p>
    <p>
      With this parting shot, he made a violent exit. Pérousse left alone,
      dismissed him, with all other harassments from his mind; for being
      entirely without a conscience, he had very little care as to the results
      of the King's reported intentions. He was preparing a brilliant speech,
      which he intended to deliver if occasion demanded; and on his own
      coolness, mendacity and pluck, he staked his future.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If I fail," he said to himself; "I will go to the United States, and end
      by becoming President! There are many such plans open to a man of
      resources!"
    </p>
    <p>
      During the ensuing few days there were some extra gaieties at the Palace,&mdash;and
      the King and Queen were seen daily in public. Everywhere, they were
      greeted with frantic outbursts of cheering, and the recent riotous
      outbreaks seemed altogether forgotten. The Opera was crowded nightly, and
      undeterred by the fear of any fresh manifestations of popular discontent,
      their Majesties were again present. This time the King was the first to
      lead off the applause that hailed Pequita's dancing. And how her little
      feet flew!&mdash;how her eyes sparkled with rapture&mdash;how the dark
      curls tossed, and the cherry lips smiled! To her the King remained
      Pasquin!&mdash;a kind of monarch in a fairy tale, who scattered benefits
      at a touch, and sunshine with a glance, and who deserved all the love and
      loyalty of every subject in the kingdom! But she had never had any idea of
      'Revolution,' poor child!&mdash;save such a revolving of chance and
      circumstance as should enable her father to live in comfort, without
      anxiety for his latter days. And perhaps at the bottom of all political or
      religious fanaticism we should find an equally simple root of cause for
      the effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day at last came when Sergius Thord held his mighty 'mass meeting,'
      convened in the Cathedral square,&mdash;all ready for marching orders. No
      interference was offered either from soldiery or police; and the people
      came pouring up from every quarter of the city in their thousands and tens
      of thousands. By noon, the tall lace-like spire of the Cathedral towered
      above a vast sea of human heads, which from a distance looked like
      swarming bees; and as the bells struck the hour, Thord, mounting the steps
      of a monument erected to certain heroes who had long ago fallen in battle,
      was greeted with a roar of acclamation like the thunder of heaven's own
      artillery. But even while the multitude still shouted and cheered, the
      sight of another figure, which quietly ascended to the same position,
      caused a sudden hush,&mdash;a gradually deepening silence of amazement and
      awe,&mdash;and then finally swift recognition.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The King!" cried a voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pasquin Leroy!" shouted another, who was answered by yells and shrieks of
      derision.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The King!" was again the cry. And as the vast crowd circled round and
      round, its million eyes wonderingly upturned, Sergius Thord suddenly
      lifted his cap and waved it:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ay! The King!" His voice rang over the heads of the people with a rich
      thrill of command. "The King, who here declares himself the friend of our
      Cause! The King, who is with us to-day of his own will, at his own
      request, by his own choice!&mdash;without escort,&mdash;unarmed&mdash;defenceless!
      The King! The King who has resolved to go with us, and demand justice for
      his overtaxed and suffering subjects! The King, who is one with us!&mdash;who
      seeks no greater kingliness than that of being loved and trusted by his
      People!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The surprise of this announcement was so truly overpowering, that for the
      moment the mighty mass of men stood inert; then,&mdash;as the situation
      flashed upon them, such a thunder of cheering broke out as seemed to make
      the very earth rock and the houses in the square tremble. The King
      himself, standing by Thord, grew pale as he heard it, and his eyes were
      suffused with something like tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      "By Heaven!" he murmured; "The love of this people is worth having!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did you ever doubt it?" queried Thord slowly, eyeing him with a touch of
      wonder not unmixed with jealousy; "There is only one power which keeps a
      king on his throne&mdash;the confidence of the nation! You had nearly lost
      that! For though there is nothing so easy to win, there is nothing so easy
      to lose!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "True!" said the monarch, his eyes still resting tenderly on the excited
      multitude below him. "I have deserved little at the people's hands&mdash;but
      perhaps&mdash;when I am gone&mdash;" he paused abruptly, then with a smile
      added&mdash;"Give us our marching orders, Sergius!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Thord obeyed,&mdash;and very soon, under his command, the huge multitude
      arranged itself in blocks, or regiments, perfectly organised in different
      companies, and entirely prepared to keep order. Dividing into equal lines
      they made way quickly and with enthusiasm as they perceived the King's
      charger, which, richly caparisoned, had been brought for his Majesty at
      Thord's own earnest request.
    </p>
    <p>
      When all was ready, the King sprang into the saddle, and gathering the
      reins in one hand, sat for a moment bare-headed, the people surging round
      him with repeated outbursts of applause. Without a weapon,&mdash;without a
      single man of his own household to bear him company,&mdash;without any
      armed escort,&mdash;he remained there enthroned;&mdash;the centre,&mdash;not
      of 'society,'&mdash;but of the People, who gathered round him as their
      visible Head, with as much shouting and enthusiasm and worship, as if he
      had, in his own person, made the conquest, single-handed, of a hundred
      nations! Never, in his most gorgeous apparel,&mdash;never, even when robed
      and crowned in state, had he looked so noble; never had he seemed so
      worthy of the highest honour, reverence and admiration, as now! At a
      signal from Thord, who led the way on foot, the thousands of the city
      began to march to the House of Government, all gathering round one
      principal figure, that of their King. A group of workmen constituted
      themselves his body-guard, protecting his proudly-stepping charger from so
      much as a stone that might startle it or check its progress, and thus&mdash;liberated
      from the protection of flunkeys and flatterers,&mdash;the monarch,
      surrounded by his true subjects advanced together as one Body, to
      challenge and overthrow a fraudulent Ministry, whose measures had been
      drawn up and passed, not for the good of the country, but for the
      financial advantage and protection of themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      Never was such a wondrous sight seen, as that almost interminable
      procession through the broad thoroughfares of the city, headed by a
      Socialist, and centred by a King! No Royal ceremonial, overburdened with
      snobbish conventionalities and hypocritical parade, ever presented so
      splendid and imposing a sight as that concentrated mass of the actual
      people,&mdash;the working muscle and sinew of the land's common weal,
      marching in steady and triumphant order,&mdash;surging like the billows of
      the sea around that brave ship, their Sovereign, cheering him to the echo,
      and waving around him the flags of the country, while he, still
      bare-headed, rode dauntless in their midst looking every inch a king!&mdash;more
      kingly indeed than he had ever seemed, and more established in the
      affections of his subjects than any living monarch of the time. So was he
      brought with ceaseless acclamation to the Government House, where, as all
      knew, he purposed denouncing Carl Pérousse;&mdash;and thus did he assert
      in his own person that a king, supported by a nation, is more powerful
      than any government built up by mere party agency!
    </p>
    <p>
      And even so, at his best and bravest, two women looked upon him and loved
      him! One, from the outskirts of the great crowd where, shrouded close in
      her veil, she waited tremblingly near the Government buildings, and saw
      him alight from his charger, and enter there, amid the wild shoutings of
      the populace,&mdash;the other, from a high window in the Royal Palace,
      where she leaned watching the crowd,&mdash;the sunlight catching the
      diamonds at her breast and sparkling in her proud cold eyes. And over the
      whole city rang the continuous and exultant cry:
    </p>
    <p>
      "The King! The King!"
    </p>
    <p>
      And perhaps only one soul, prophetic in instinct, foresaw any terror in
      the triumph!&mdash;only one voice, low and tremulous and weighted with
      tears and prayers, murmured:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, dear God! Would he were not a King!"

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXI. &mdash; A VOTE FOR LOVE
    </h2>
    <p>
      Next day it was known through the length and breadth of the city that the
      King, so long judged as a political Dummy, had proved himself a living,
      acting authority. Every journal in city and province led off its news
      under the one chief heading,&mdash;'The King's Speech.' The King had
      spoken;&mdash;and with no uncertain voice. Cool, brilliant in wording,
      concise in statement,&mdash;cuttingly correct in facts, convincing in
      argument, his unexpected denouncement of Carl Pérousse, and the Pérousse
      'majority,' swept the Government off their feet by its daring courage, and
      still more daring veracity. Documentary evidence of the dishonourable
      speculations with the public money which had been so freely indulged in by
      the Secretary of State, aided and abetted by the Premier, was handed by
      the King in person to the authorities whose business it was to examine
      such proofs,&mdash;the dishonourable measures used to retain the
      'majority' were fully exposed, and the whole House stood thunderstruck and
      mentally paralysed, under the straight accusation and merciless
      condemnation launched at their own lax tolerance of such iniquitous
      practices, by their reigning monarch. With perfect dignity and impressive
      calm, the King quietly demanded whether M. Carl Pérousse would be pleased
      to explain his actions? Whether he had anything to say in response to the
      charges brought against him? To this last query, after a dead silence,
      during which every eye was fixed on the defaulting Minister, who, in the
      course of the Royal speech had seen every bulwark of his own intended
      defence torn away from him, Pérousse, with an ashy white countenance
      answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing!"
    </p>
    <p>
      And the silence around him continued; a silence more expressive than any
      outspoken word of scorn.
    </p>
    <p>
      But more surprises were in store for the Ministry, which found itself thus
      suddenly overthrown. The King announced the marriage of his son, the Crown
      Prince, to 'a daughter of the People'! Boldly, and with an ardent passion
      of truth lighting up every feature of his handsome countenance, he stated
      this overwhelming piece of news in a perfectly matter-of-fact way, adding,
      that in consequence of the step taken,&mdash;a step which he did not
      himself in any way regret,&mdash;the Crown Prince asked to be allowed to
      resign the Throne in favour of his brother Rupert.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Unless," continued his Majesty, "the Nation should be proved ready to
      accept the wife he has chosen. It is needless to add that my son has
      married without my consent, and this is the reason of his present absence
      from the country. If the Nation accepts his wife, he will return to the
      Nation; if not, I am bound to say, knowing his mind, that there is nothing
      to be done, but to declare Prince Rupert Heir to the Throne. This,
      however, I personally desire may be left to the consideration and vote of
      the people!"
    </p>
    <p>
      And when the House rose on that astonishing afternoon, they knew they were
      no longer a House,&mdash;they knew the Government was entirely overthrown,
      and that there would be a new Ministry and a General Election. They had to
      realise also, that their 'Bills' for imposing fresh taxes on the people
      were mere waste paper,&mdash;and they heard likewise with redoubled
      amazement that the King had decided to resign half his revenues for the
      space of five years, to assist the deficit in the National Exchequer.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the conclusion of the whole unprecedented scene, they saw the King
      received, as it were, into the arms of a frenzied crowd, numbering many
      tens of thousands, which spread round all the Government buildings, and
      poured itself in thick streams through every street and thoroughfare, and
      they had to accept the fact that their 'majority' was reduced to a
      minority so infinitesimal, amid the greater wave of popular resolve, that
      it was not worth counting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carl Pérousse, leaving the House by a private door of egress, shamed,
      disgraced and crestfallen as he was, dared not trust the very sight of
      himself to such an overwhelming multitude, and managed by lucky chance to
      escape unobserved. He was assisted in this manoeuvre by General Bernhoff.
      The Chief of the Police perceived him slinking cautiously along the
      side-wall of an alley where the crowd had not penetrated, and helped him
      into a passing cab that he might be driven rapidly and safely to his home.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will no doubt excuse me"&mdash;said the General with a slight smile&mdash;"for
      not having acted more rigorously in the matter of the suspected 'Pasquin
      Leroy'! I am afraid I should never have summed up sufficient impudence to
      ask the King to sign a warrant against himself!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Pérousse muttered an inarticulate oath by way of reply. He realised fully
      that the game for him was lost. His speech of defence, so carefully
      prepared had been useless, for he could not have uttered it in the face of
      the damnatory evidence against him pronounced by the King, and verified by
      his own public actions. Yet his audacity had not, in the main, deserted
      him. He knew that, owing to his proved defalcations and fraudulent use of
      the public money, his own property would be confiscated to the Crown,&mdash;but
      he had always kept himself well prepared for emergencies, and had invested
      in foreign securities under various assumed names. Turning his attention
      to America, he felt pretty sure he could do something there,&mdash;but so
      far as his own country was concerned, he submitted to the inevitable,
      feeling that his day was done.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Jew is always triumphant!" he said, as he opened Jost's newspaper
      next morning, and read a full account of the proceedings in the House,
      described with all the 'colour' and gush of Jost's most melodramatic
      reporter. "There is no doubt a 'leader' on my 'unhappy position' as a
      fallen, but once trusted Minister!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He was right; there was! A gravely-reproachful, sternly-commiserating
      'leader,' wherein the apparently impeccable and highly conscientious
      writer 'deplored' the laxity of those who supported M. Carl Pérousse in
      his 'regrettable' scheme of self-aggrandisement.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The rascal!" ejaculated Pérousse, as he read. "If I ever get a fresh
      start in the United States or South Africa, I'll put him on a gridiron,
      and roast him to slow music!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile the whole country went mad over the King. No man was ever so
      idolised; no man was ever made the centre of more hero-worship. In all the
      excitement of a General Election, the wave of loyalty rose to its
      extremest height, and no candidate that was not ready to follow the lines
      of reform laid down by the monarch, had a ghost of a chance of being
      returned as a deputy. With the abolition of the tax on bread, the popular
      jubilation increased; bonfires were lit on every hill,&mdash;rockets
      flared up star-like from every rocky point upon the coast, and the Nation
      gave itself entirely up to joy.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the long dormant sentiment of the multitude was roused to a fever-heat
      by the story of Prince Humphry's marriage, and he too, next to his father,
      became a veritable hero of romance in the eyes of the people, for whom
      Love, and all pertaining to love-matters form the most interesting part of
      life. Following his announcement in the House, the King issued a
      'manifesto,' setting forth the facts of his son's union with 'One Gloria
      Ronsard, of The Islands,' and requesting the vote of the people for, or
      against, the Prince as Heir-Apparent to the Throne.
    </p>
    <p>
      The result of this bold and candid reliance on the Nation was one which
      could never have been foreseen by so-called 'diplomatic' statesmen, who
      are accustomed to juggle with simple facts, and who strive to cover up and
      conceal the too distinct plainness of truth. An electric thrill of
      chivalrous enthusiasm pulsated through the entire country; and the
      unanimous vote of the people was returned to the King in entire favour of
      the Crown Prince and his chosen bride. Perhaps no one was more astonished
      at this than the King himself. He had been prepared for considerable
      friction; he had been quite sure of opposition on the part of 'Society,'
      but, Society, moved for once from its usual selfishness by the boldness
      and daring of a heroic king, had ranked itself entirely on his side, and
      was ready and even anxious to accept in Prince Humphry a new kind of
      'Cophetua,' even if he had chosen to wed a beggar-maid! And it so chanced
      that there were many persons who had seen Gloria,&mdash;and among these
      was Sergius Thord, He had not only seen her, but known her;&mdash;he had
      studied her character and qualities,&mdash;and was aware that she
      possessed one of the most pure and beautiful of womanly souls;&mdash;and
      though taken by surprise at the discovery that the young 'sailor' she had
      wedded was no other than the Crown Prince, yet, after the experience he
      had personally gone through with one 'Pasquin Leroy,' he could scarcely
      feel that any news, even of the most wonderful kind, was so wonderful
      after all! So that, as soon as he learned the truth, he brought all his
      enormous 'following' into unanimity as regarded the Prince's romantic
      love-story; and ere long there was not one in the metropolis at least, who
      did not consider the marriage a good thing, and likely to weld even more
      closely together the harmonious relationship between people and Throne.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so it chanced, that even while the General Election was still going on
      all over the country, an incessant popular clamour was made for the
      instant return of the Prince to his native land. The papers teemed with
      suggestions as to the 'welcoming home' of the young hero of romance and
      his bride, and Professor von Glauben, mentally giddy with the whirl of
      events, was nevertheless triumphantly elated.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now that you know everything," he said to Sir Roger de Launay, "I hope
      you are satisfied! My 'jam-pot' that you spoke of, has turned out to be a
      special Sweetmeat for the whole nation!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am very much surprised, I confess!" said Sir Roger slowly; "I should
      hardly have thought such a love-story possible in these modern days. And I
      should certainly never have given the nation credit for so much
      sentiment!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A nation is always sentimental!" declared the Professor; "What does a
      Government exist for? Merely to keep national sentiment in order.
      Ministers know well enough, that despite the various 'Bills' brought in
      for material advantage and improvement, they have always to deal with the
      imaginative aspiration of the populace, rather than their conception of
      logic. For truly, the masses have no logic at all; they will not stop to
      count the cost of an Army, but they will shout themselves hoarse at the
      sight of the Flag! The Flag is the Sentiment; the Army is the Fact. The
      King has secured all the votes of the nation on a question of Sentiment
      only,&mdash;but there is this pleasant scientific 'fact underlying the
      sentiment,&mdash;Gloria is fit to be the mother of kings! And that is what
      I will not say of any royally-born woman I know!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Roger was silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Consider our present Queen as a mother only!" he went on; "Beautiful and
      impassive as a snow-peak with the snow shining upon it! What of her sons?
      The Crown Prince is the best of them,&mdash;but he has only been saved
      from inherited mischief by his love for Gloria. The other two boys, Rupert
      and Cyprian, will probably be selfish libertines!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Roger opened his eyes in astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why do you say that?" he asked; "They are harmless lads enough! Cricket
      and football are enough to make them happy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "For the present, no doubt!" agreed Von Glauben; "But it sometimes happens
      that the young human animal who expends all his brains on kicking a
      football, is quite likely to expend another sort of force when he grows
      up, in morally kicking other things! At least, that is how I regard it.
      The over-cultivation of physical strength leads to mental callousness and
      brutality. These are scientific points which require discussion,&mdash;not
      with you,&mdash;but with a scientist. Nothing should be overdone. Too much
      enervation and lack of athleticism leads to moral deterioration certainly,&mdash;but
      so does too much 'sport' as they call it. There is a happy medium to be
      obtained on both sides, but human beings generally miss it. Prince
      Humphry, born of a beautiful, introspective, selfish&mdash;yes, I repeat
      it!&mdash;selfish mother, would, if he had married a hard-natured, cold
      and conventional wife, probably have been the most indifferent, casual,
      and careless sovereign that ever reigned; but, united as he is to a
      trusting, warm-hearted, loving, womanly woman like Gloria, he will
      probably make himself the idol of the Nation."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not more so than his father is!" said Sir Roger, with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ach so! That would be difficult, I grant you!" agreed the Professor; "As
      I told you, Roger, at the beginning of this drama in which we have both
      played our little parts; no harm ever came undeservedly to a brave man
      with a good conscience!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "True! And no harm has come to the King&mdash;as yet!" said Sir Roger
      thoughtfully. "But I sometimes fear one man&mdash;&mdash;!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sergius Thord?" suggested Von Glauben; "To speak honestly, so do I! But I
      watch him&mdash;I watch him closely! He loves Lotys, as a tiger loves its
      mate,&mdash;and if he should ever suspect&mdash;&mdash;!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hush!" said Roger quickly; "Do not speak of it! I assure you I am always
      on guard!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good! So am I! But Thord is too busy just now climbing the hill to look
      either backward or aside. When he reaches the summit, it is possible he
      may see the whole landscape at a glance!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He will reach the summit very soon!" said De Launay; "His election as
      deputy for the city, is certain. From the moment he announced himself as
      candidate, there has been no opposition."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He will be returned by an overwhelming majority," said the Professor;
      "And he will gain all the power he has been working for. Also, with the
      power, he will obtain all the difficulty, responsibility, disappointment
      and bitterness. Power is a dangerous possession, unless it is accompanied
      by a cool head; and in that our friend Sergius Thord is lacking. He is a
      creature of impulse&mdash;and a savage creature too!&mdash;a half-educated
      genius,&mdash;than which nothing in the shape of humanity is more
      desperately difficult to manage!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lotys can manage him!" said Sir Roger.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That depends!" And the Professor rubbed his nose irritably. "Women are
      excellent diplomatists up to a certain point, but their limit is reached
      when they fall in love! Passion and enthusiasm transform them into quite
      as absurd fools as&mdash;men!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Roger smiled, and changed the subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      But in a few days, what had been foreshadowed in their conversation came
      true. One of the chief results of the General Election was the triumphal
      return of Sergius Thord as Deputy for the Metropolis by an enormous
      majority; and in the evening of the day on which the polling was declared,
      great crowds assembled beneath the windows of his house,&mdash;that house
      so long known as the quarters of the Revolutionary Committee,&mdash;roaring
      themselves hoarse with acclamation. He was, of course, called out before
      them to speak,&mdash;and he yielded to the clamorous demand, as perforce
      he was bound to do, but strangely enough, with extreme reluctance.
    </p>
    <p>
      A certain vague weariness depressed his spirits; his undisputed election
      as one of the most important Government-representatives of the people,
      lacked the savour of the triumph he had expected;&mdash;and like all those
      who have worked for years to win a coveted post and succeed at last in
      winning it, he was filled with the fatal satiety of accomplishment. Power,&mdash;temporal
      power,&mdash;was after all not so great as it had seemed! He had climbed&mdash;he
      had striven; but all the joy was contained in the climbing and the
      striving. Now that he had gained his point there seemed nothing left to
      prick afresh his flagging ambition. Nevertheless, he succeeded in
      addressing his enthusiastic followers and worshippers with something of
      his old fervour and fire,&mdash;sufficiently well, at any rate, to satisfy
      them, and send them off with renewed shouts of exultation, expressive of
      their continued reliance on his courage and ability. But, when left alone
      at last, his heart suddenly failed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is the use of it!" he thought wearily; "True, I now represent the
      city,&mdash;I lead its opinions&mdash;I am its mouth-piece for the State,&mdash;and
      the wrongs and injuries done to the million are mine to bring before the
      Government; and my business it will be to force remedial measures for the
      same. But what then? There will be, there must be, constant discussion,
      argument, contradiction,&mdash;for there are always conflicting opinions
      in every aspect of human affairs,&mdash;and it will be my work to put down
      all contradiction,&mdash;all opposition,&mdash;and to carry the People's
      Cause with a firm hand. Yet&mdash;after all, if I succeed, it will be the
      King's doing,&mdash;not mine! To him I partly owe my present power; the
      power I had before, was <i>all</i> my own!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Sullen and silent he brooded on the changes in his fortunes with no very
      satisfied mind. While he could not, as a brave man, refuse his respect and
      homage to the monarch who had quietly made himself complete master of the
      'Revolutionary' organisation, and who had succeeded in turning thousands
      of disaffected persons into ardent Loyalists, he was nevertheless troubled
      by a lurking suspicion that Lotys had secretly known and favoured the
      King's scheme. Vaguely ashamed in his own mind of the idea, he yet found
      himself giving way to it now and again, as he remembered how she had
      defended his life,&mdash;not once but twice,&mdash;and how she had often
      frankly declared her admiration for the unselfishness, heroism, and
      tireless energy of the so-called 'Pasquin Leroy.' After much perplexed
      meditation, he came at last to one resolve.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She must be my wife!" he said, his eyes gleaming with a sudden fire of
      passion and determination combined; "If,&mdash;as she says,&mdash;she does
      not love me, she must learn to love me! Then, all will be well! With her,
      it is possible I may reach still greater heights; without her, I can do
      nothing!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Meantime, while the results of the Election to what was now called 'The
      Royal Government,' were being daily recorded in all parts of the world,
      and the King himself, from a selection of the ablest and most
      honourably-proved men of the time, was forming a new Ministry, the news of
      these radical changes in the kingdom's affairs, spreading rapidly
      everywhere by cable, as news always spreads nowadays, reached a certain
      far corner in one of the most beautiful provinces of India,&mdash;a corner
      scarcely known to the conventional traveller,&mdash;where, in a wondrous
      palace, lent to them by one of the most civilised and kindly of Oriental
      potentates,&mdash;a palace surrounded by gardens that might have been a
      true copy of the fabled Eden, Prince Humphry and the fair 'Gloria' of his
      life, were passing a happy, 'hidden-away' time of perfect repose.
    </p>
    <p>
      The evening on which they learned that their own nation demanded their
      return was 'like the night of Al-Kadir, better than a thousand months.'
      All day long the heat had been intense,&mdash;and they had remained
      indoors enjoying the coolness of marble courts and corridors, and plashing
      fountains,&mdash;but with the sunset a soft breeze had sprung up, and
      Gloria, passing into the shadiest corner of the gardens, had laid herself
      down in a silken hammock swung between two broad sycamore trees, and
      there, gently swaying to and fro, she watched her husband reading the
      various European journals that had arrived for his host by that day's
      mail. Beautiful always, she had grown lovelier than ever in these halcyon
      days of rest, when 'Love took up the harp of Life and smote on all the
      chords with might; Smote the chord of Self, that, trembling, pass'd in
      music out of sight.' To her native grace she now united a distinctive
      dignity which added to her always gracious and queenly charm, and never
      had she looked more exquisite than now, when rocking gently in the
      suspended network of woven turquoise silk fringed with silver, she rested
      her head against cushions of the same delicate hue, and turned her
      expressive eyes enquiringly towards her husband,&mdash;wondering what kept
      him so silent, and what was the cause of the little line of anxiety which
      furrowed his brow. Clad in a loose diaphanous robe of white, with a simple
      band of silver clasping it round her supple form, her rich hair caught
      carelessly back with a knot of scarlet passion-flowers, she looked a
      creature too fair for earth, a being all divine; and the Prince presently
      turning his glances towards her, evidently thought so, from the adoring
      tenderness with which he bent over her and kissed the ripe, red, smiling
      lips which pouted so deliciously to take the offered caress.
    </p>
    <p>
      "They want us back, my Gloria!" he said; "The Nation asks for me&mdash;and
      for <i>you</i>!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She raised herself a little on one arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do they know all?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes! The King, my father, has announced everything concerning our
      marriage, not only to the Government, but by special 'manifesto' to the
      People. I did not think he would be so brave!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Or so true!" said Gloria, her eyes darkening and deepening with the
      intensity of her thought. "Let me read this strange news, Humphry!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He gave her the papers,&mdash;and a few tears sparkled on her lashes like
      diamonds and fell, as with a beating heart she read of the complete
      triumph of the King over the Socialist and Revolutionary party,&mdash;of
      his march with the multitude to the Government House,&mdash;of his bold
      denunciation of Carl Pérousse, ending in the utter overthrow of a
      fraudulent Ministry,&mdash;and of his determination to renounce for five
      years, one half his royal revenues in order to personally assist the
      deficit in the National Exchequer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He is, in very truth a King!" she said, looking up with flushed cheeks
      and sparkling eyes,&mdash;"Surely the noblest in the world!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Prince Humphry's face expressed wonderment as well as admiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have been utterly mistaken in him,"&mdash;he confessed,&mdash;"Or else,
      something has greatly changed his ideas. I should never have deemed him
      capable of running so much risk of his position, or of showing so much
      heroism, candour and self-sacrifice. All my life I have been accustomed to
      see him more or less indifferent to everything but his own pleasure, and
      more or less careless of the griefs of others; but now it seems as if he
      had kept himself back on purpose, only to declare his true character more
      openly and boldly in the end!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Gloria read on, with eagerness and interest, till she came to the King's
      'manifesto' regarding his son's marriage with 'a daughter of the People.'
      She pointed to this expression with the tapering, rosy point of her
      delicate little finger.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is me!" she said; "I <i>am</i> a daughter of the People! I am proud
      of the name!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are my wife!" said the Prince; "And you are Crown Princess of the
      realm!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked meditative.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am not sure I like that title so well!" she said surveying him archly
      under the shadow of her long lashes; "Indeed&mdash;if <i>you</i> were not
      Crown Prince,&mdash;I should not like it at all!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Prince Humphry smiled, and tenderly touched the scarlet passion-flowers in
      her hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But as I am Crown Prince, you will try to put up with it, my Gloria!" and
      he kissed her again. "We must return home, Sweetheart!&mdash;and as
      speedily as possible,&mdash;though I am sorry our restful honey-time is
      over!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Gloria looked wistfully around her,&mdash;over the long smooth undulating
      lawns, the thickets of myrtle and orange, the lovely deep groves of trees,
      and away to the peaks of the distant dark blue hills, over which a great
      golden moon was slowly rising.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am sorry too!" she said; "I could live always like this, in peace with
      you, far, far away from all the world! Hark!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She held up her hand to invite attention, as the delicious warble of a
      nightingale, or 'bul-bul' broke the heated silence into liquid melody. Her
      lover-husband took that little uplifted hand, and drawing it in his own,
      kissed it fondly,&mdash;and so for a moment they were very quiet, while
      the little brown bird of music poured from its palpitating throat a
      cadence of heart-moving song. Gradually, the golden splendour of the
      Indian moonlight widened through the trees, enveloping them in its clear
      luminous radiance; and the two beautiful human creatures, gazing into each
      other's eyes with all the unspeakable rapture of a perfect love, touched
      that wondrous height of pure mutual passion which makes things temporal
      seem very far off, and things eternal very near.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If life could always be like this," murmured Gloria; "We should surely
      understand God better! We should feel that He truly loved us, and wished
      us to love each other! Ah, if only all the world were as happy as I am!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will help to make a great part of it so, my beloved!" said the
      Prince; "You will bring with you into our kingdom, comfort for the
      sorrowful, aid to the poor, sympathy for the lonely, thought for all! You
      will forget nothing that calls for your remembrance, my Sweet! And one
      nation at least, will know what it is to have a true woman's love to light
      up the darkness of a Throne!"
    </p>
    <p>
      That night a cable message was sent by the Prince to his father, stating
      his intention to return home immediately. The Oriental potentate who had
      generously placed his palace at the Royal lovers' disposal, and had
      religiously preserved the secret of their identity and whereabouts, being
      himself much fascinated and interested by the romance of their story, now
      commanded festivals and illuminations for their entertainment before their
      departure, and within a fortnight of the despatch of his message, the
      Prince's yacht had left the mystic shores of the East, and started on its
      homeward journey.
    </p>
    <p>
      The news that the Crown Prince was returning with his bride, set all the
      country in a flutter of excitement, and the General Election being
      concluded, and the meeting of the new Government being deferred until
      after the Heir-Apparent's return, the people of every city and town and
      province set themselves busily to work to prepare suitable festivities for
      the homecoming of the Royal pair. At The Islands especially the spirit of
      enthusiasm was complete&mdash;all sorts of ideas for fêtes and sports, and
      bonfires and illuminations, exercised the minds of the simple fisher-folk,
      who were wild with joy at the singular destiny that had befallen their
      'waif of the sea' as they were wont to call the beautiful girl who had
      grown up among them,&mdash;and the aged Réné Ronsard was made the centre
      of their interest and attention,&mdash;even of their adulation. But
      Ronsard had grown very listless of late. His age began to tell heavily
      upon him, and the news that Gloria was returning in all triumph as Crown
      Princess, moved him but little.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She would have been happier as a simple sailor's wife!" he averred, when
      Professor von Glauben, who visited him constantly, sought to rouse him
      from the apathy into which he appeared to have sunk. "The greater the
      position, the heavier the burden!&mdash;the more outwardly brilliant the
      appearance of life, the deeper its secret bitterness!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But Gloria has Love with her, my friend!" urged the Professor; "And Love
      makes the bitterest things sweet!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Ronsard's aged eyes sparkled faintly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ay, Love!" he echoed; "A dream&mdash;a delusion&mdash;and a snare! Unless
      it be a love strong enough to drag one down to death!&mdash;and then it is
      the strongest power in the world! It is a terror and a martyrdom,&mdash;and
      in nothing shall its desire be thwarted! If It calls&mdash;even kings
      obey!"

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXII. &mdash; BETWEEN TWO PASSIONS
    </h2>
    <p>
      Slowly, and with hesitating steps, Sergius Thord mounted the long flight
      of stairs leading to the quiet attic which Lotys called 'home.' Here she
      lived; here she had chosen to live ever since Thord had made her, as he
      said, the 'Soul of the Revolutionary Ideal.' Here, since the King had
      conquered the Revolutionary Ideal altogether, and had made it a Loyalist
      centre, did she dwell still, though she had now some thoughts of yielding
      to the child Pequita's earnest pleading, and taking up her abode with her
      and her father, in a pretty little house in the suburbs which, since
      Pequita's success as <i>première danseuse</i> at the Opera, Sholto had
      been able to afford, and to look upon as something like a comfortable
      dwelling-place. For with the election of Thord to the dignity of a Deputy,
      had, of course, come the necessity of resigning his old quarters where his
      'Revolutionary' meetings had been held,&mdash;and he now resided in a more
      'respectable' quarter of the city, in such sober, yet distinctive fashion
      as became one who was a friend of the King's, and who was likely to be a
      Minister some day, when he had further proved his political mettle. So
      that Sholto had no longer any need to try and eke out a scanty subsistence
      by letting rooms to revolutionists and 'suspects' generally,&mdash;and
      Thord himself had helped him to make a change for the better, as had also
      the King.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Lotys had not as yet moved. She had lived so long among the
      desperately poor, who were accustomed to go to her for sympathy and aid,
      that she could not contemplate leaving so many sick and suffering and
      sorrowful ones alone to fight their bitter battle. So had she said, at
      least, to Thord, when he had endeavoured to persuade her to establish
      herself in greater comfort, and in a part of the city which had a
      'better-class' reputation. She had listened to his suggestions with a
      somewhat melancholy smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Once,&mdash;and not so very long ago,&mdash;for you there was no such
      thing as the 'better-class,' Sergius!" she said; "You were wont to declare
      that rich and poor alike were all one family in the sight of God!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have not altered my opinion," said Thord, a slight flush colouring his
      cheek; "But&mdash;you are a woman&mdash;and as a woman should have every
      care and tenderness."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So should my still poorer sisters," she replied; "And it is for those who
      have least comfort, that comfort should be provided. I am perfectly well
      and happy where I am!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Remembering her fixed ideas on this point, there was an uneasy sense of
      trouble in Thord's mind as he ventured again on what he feared would be a
      fruitless errand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If I could command her!" he thought, chafing inwardly at his own
      impotence to persuade or lead this woman, whose character and will were so
      much more self-contained and strong than his own. "If I could only
      exercise some authority over her! But I cannot. What small debt of
      gratitude she owed me as a child, has long been cleared by her constant
      work and the assistance she has given to me,&mdash;and unless she will
      consent to be my wife, I know I shall lose her altogether. For she will
      never submit to live on money that she has not earned."
    </p>
    <p>
      Arrived at the summit of the staircase he had been climbing, he knocked at
      the first door which faced him on the uppermost landing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come in!" said the low, sweet voice that had thrilled and comforted so
      many human souls; and entering as he was bidden, he saw Lotys seated in a
      low chair near the window, rocking a tiny infant, so waxen-like and
      meagre, that it looked more like a corpse than a living child.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The mother died last night," she said gently, in response to his look of
      interrogation; "She had been struggling against want and sickness for a
      long time. God was merciful in taking her at last! The father has to go
      out all day in search of work,&mdash;often a vain search; so I do what I
      can for this poor little one!"
    </p>
    <p>
      And she bent over the forlorn waif of humanity, kissing its pale small
      face, and pressing it soothingly to her warm, full breast. She looked
      quite beautiful in that Madonna-like attitude of protection and love,&mdash;her
      gold hair drooping against the slim whiteness of her throat,&mdash;her
      deep blue eyes full of that tenderness for the defenceless and weak, which
      is the loveliest of all womanly expressions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sergius Thord drew a chair opposite to her, and sat down.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are always doing good, Lotys!" he said, with a slight tremor in his
      voice; "There is no day in your life without its record of help to the
      helpless!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head deprecatingly, and went on caressing and soothing the
      tiny babe in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a pause, he spoke again.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have come to you, Lotys, to ask you many things!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked up with a little smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you need advice, Sergius? Nay, surely not!&mdash;you have passed
      beyond it&mdash;you are a great man!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He moved impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Great? What do you mean? I am Deputy for the city, it is true&mdash;but
      that is not the height of my ambition; it is only a step towards it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "To what do you aspire?" she queried. "A place in the Ministry? You will
      get that if you wait long enough! And then&mdash;will you be satisfied?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No&mdash;I shall never be satisfied&mdash;never till&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      He broke off and shifted his position. His fierce eyes rested tenderly
      upon her as she sat holding the motherless infant caressingly in her arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have heard the latest news?" he asked presently, "That Carl Pérousse
      has left the country?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, I have not heard that," said Lotys; "But why was he allowed to go
      without being punished for his dishonesty?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "To punish him, would have involved the punishment of many more associated
      with him," replied Thord; "His estates are confiscated;&mdash;the
      opportunity was given him to escape, in order to avoid further Ministerial
      scandals,&mdash;and he has taken the chance afforded him!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She was silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Jost too has gone," pursued Thord; "He has sold his paper to his chief
      rival. So that now both journals are amalgamated under one head, and work
      for the same cause&mdash;our cause, and the King's."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lotys looked up with a slight smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is the same old system then?" she said. "For whereas before there was
      one newspaper subsidised by a fraudulent Ministry, there are now two,
      subsidised by the Royal Government;&mdash;with which the Socialist party
      is united!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He frowned.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You mistake! We shall subsidise no newspaper whatever. We shall not
      pursue any such mistaken policy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Believe me, you will be compelled to do so, Sergius!" she declared, still
      smiling; "Or some other force will step in! Do you not see that politics
      always revolve in the same monotonous round? You have called me the Soul
      of an Ideal,&mdash;but even when I worked my hardest with you, I knew it
      was an Ideal that could never be realised! But the practice of your
      theories led me among the poor, where I felt I could be useful,&mdash;and
      for this reason I conjoined what brains I had, what strength I had, with
      yours. Yet, no matter how men talk of 'Revolution,' any and every form of
      government is bound to run on the old eternal lines, whether it be
      Imperial, Socialistic or Republican. Men are always the same children&mdash;never
      satisfied,&mdash;ever clamouring for change,&mdash;tired of one toy and
      crying for another,&mdash;so on and on,&mdash;till the end! I would rather
      save a life"&mdash;and she glanced pityingly down upon the sleeping infant
      she held-"than upset a throne!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I quite believe that;" said Sergius slowly; "You are a woman, most
      womanly! If you could only learn to love&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      He paused, startled at the sudden rush of colour that spread over her
      cheeks and brow; but it was a wave of crimson that soon died away, leaving
      her very pale.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Love is not for me, Sergius!" she said; "I am no longer young. Besides,
      the days of romance never existed for me at all, and now it is too late. I
      have grown too much into the habit of looking upon men as poor little
      emmets, clambering up and down the same tiny hill of earth,&mdash;their
      passions, their ambitions, their emotions, their fightings and conquests,
      their panoply and pride, do not interest me, though they move me to pity;
      I seem to stand alone, looking beyond, straight through the glorious world
      of Nature, up to the infinite spaces above, searching for God!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yet you care for that waif?" said Thord with a gesture towards the child
      she held.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because it is helpless," she answered; "only that! If it ever lives to
      grow up and be a man, it will forget that a woman ever held it, or
      cherished it so! No wild beast of the forest&mdash;no treacherous serpent
      of the jungle, is more cruel in its inherited nature, than man when he
      deals with woman;&mdash;as lover, he betrays her,&mdash;as wife, he
      neglects her,&mdash;as mother, he forgets her!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have a bad opinion of my sex!" said Thord, half angrily; "Would you
      say thus much of the King?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She started, then controlled herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The King is brave,&mdash;but beyond exceptional courage, I do not think
      he differs from other men."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you seen him lately?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No."
    </p>
    <p>
      The answer came coldly, and with evident resentment at the query. Thord
      hesitated a minute or two, looking at her yearningly; then he suddenly
      laid his hand on her arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lotys!" he said in a half-whisper; "If you would only love me! If you
      would be my wife!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She raised her dark-blue pensive eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My poor Sergius! With all your triumphs, do you still hanker for a
      wayside weed? Alas!&mdash;the weed has tough roots that cannot be pulled
      up to please you! I would make you happy if I could, dear friend!&mdash;but
      in the way you ask, I cannot!"
    </p>
    <p>
      His heart beat thickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why? Ask why the rain will not melt marble into snow! I love you, Sergius&mdash;but
      not with such love as you demand. And I would not be your wife for all the
      world!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He restrained himself with difficulty.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Again&mdash;why?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She gave a slight movement of impatience.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In the first place, because we should not agree. In the second place,
      because I abhor the very idea of marriage. I see, day by day, what
      marriage means, even among the poor&mdash;the wreck of illusions&mdash;the
      death of ideals&mdash;the despairing monotony of a mere struggle to live&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall not be poor now;" said Thord; "All my work would be to make you
      happy, Lotys! I would surround you with every grace and luxury&mdash;with
      love, with worship, with tenderness! With your intelligence and
      fascination you would be honoured,&mdash;famous!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He broke off, interrupted by her gesture of annoyance.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let me hear no more of this, Sergius!" she said. "You were very good to
      me when I was a castaway child, and I do not forget it. But you must not
      urge a claim upon me to which I cannot respond. I have given some of the
      best years of my life to assist your work, to win you your followers,&mdash;and
      to advance what I have always recognised as an exalted, though impossible
      creed&mdash;but now, for the rest of the time left to me, I must have my
      own way!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He sprang up suddenly and confronted her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My God!" he cried. "Is it possible you do not understand! All my work&mdash;all
      my plans&mdash;all my scheming and plotting has been for you&mdash;to make
      you happy! To give you high place and power! Without you, what do I care
      for the world? What do I care whether men are rich or poor&mdash;whether
      they starve or die! It is you I want to serve&mdash;you! It is for your
      sake I have desired to win honour and position. Have pity on me, Lotys!
      Have pity! I have seen you grow up to womanhood&mdash;I have loved every
      inch of your stature&mdash;every hair of the gold on your head&mdash;every
      glance of your eyes&mdash;every bright flash of your intelligent spirit!
      Oh, I have loved you, and love you, Lotys, as no man ever loved woman!
      Everything I have attempted&mdash;everything I have done, has been that
      you might think me worthier of love. For the Country and the People I care
      nothing&mdash;nothing! I only care for you!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She rose, holding the sleeping child to her like a shield. Her features
      seemed to have grown rigid with an inflexible coldness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So then," she said, "You are no better than the men you have blamed! You
      confess yourself as false to the People as the Minister you have
      displaced! You have served their Cause,&mdash;not because you love them,
      but simply because you love Me!&mdash;and you would force me to become
      your wife, not because you love Me, so much as you love Yourself! Self
      alone is at the core of your social creed! Why, you are not a whit higher
      than the vulgarest millionaire that ever stole a people's Trade to further
      his own ends!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lotys! Lotys!" he cried, stung to the quick; "You judge me wrongly&mdash;by
      Heaven, you do!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I judge you only by your own words;" she answered steadily; "They condemn
      you more than I do. I thought you were sincere in your love for the
      People! I thought your work was all for them,&mdash;not for me! I judged
      that you sought to gain authority in order to remedy their many wrongs;&mdash;but
      if, after all, you have been fighting your way to power merely to make
      yourself, as you thought, more acceptable to me as a husband, you have
      deceived me in the honesty of your intentions as grossly as you have
      deceived the King!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The King!" he cried; "The King!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She flashed a proud and passionate glance upon him&mdash;and then&mdash;he
      suddenly found himself alone. She had left the room; and though he knew
      there was only one wall, one door between them, he dared not follow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Glancing around him at the simple furniture of the chamber he stood in,
      which, though only an attic, was bright and fresh and sweet, with bunches
      of wildflowers set here and there in simple and cheap crystal vases, he
      sighed heavily. The poor and 'obscure' life was perhaps, after all, the
      highest, holiest and best! All at once his eyes lighted on one large
      cluster of flowers that were neither wild nor common, a knot of rare roses
      and magnificent orchids, tied together with a golden ribbon. He looked at
      them jealously, and his soul was assailed by sudden resentment and
      suspicion. His face changed, his teeth closed hard on his under lip, and
      he clenched his hand unconsciously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If it is so&mdash;if it should be so!" he muttered; "There may be yet
      another and more complete Day of Fate!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He left the room then, descending the stairs more rapidly than he had
      climbed them, and as he went out of the house and up the street, he
      stumbled against Paul Zouche.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Whither away, brave Deputy?" cried this irresponsible being; "Whither
      away? To rescue the poor and the afflicted?&mdash;or to stop the King from
      poaching on your own preserves?"
    </p>
    <p>
      With a force of which he was himself unconscious, he gripped Zouche by the
      arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you mean?" he whispered thickly;&mdash;"Speak! What do you know?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Zouche laughed stupidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do I know?" he echoed; "Why, what should I know, blockhead, save
      what all who have eyes to see, know as well as I do! Sergius, your grasp
      is none of the lightest; let me go!" Then as the other's hand fell from
      his arm, he continued. "It is you who are the blind man leading the blind!
      You&mdash;who like all thick-skulled reformers, can never perceive what
      goes on under your own nose! But what does it matter? What does anything
      matter? I told you long ago she would never love you; I knew long ago that
      she loved his Majesty, 'Pasquin Leroy!'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Curse you!" said Thord suddenly, in such low infuriated accents that the
      oath sounded more like a wild beast's snarl. "Why did you not tell me? Why
      did you not warn me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Zouche shrugged his shoulders, and began to sidle aimlessly along the
      roadway.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You would not have believed me!" he said; "Nobody believes anything that
      is unpleasant to themselves! If you had not some suspicion in your own
      mind, you would not believe me now! I am foolish&mdash;you are wise! I am
      a poet&mdash;you are a reformer! I am drunk&mdash;you are sober! And with
      it all, Lotys is the only one who keeps her head clear. Lotys was always
      the creature of common-sense among us; she understood you&mdash;she
      understood me&mdash;and better than either of us&mdash;she understood the
      King!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, no!" whispered Thord, more to himself than his companion; "She could
      not&mdash;she could not have known!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now you look as Nature meant you to look!" exclaimed Zouche, staring
      wildly at him; "Savage as a bear;&mdash;pitiless as a snake! God! What men
      can become when they are baulked of their desires! But it is no use, my
      Sergius!&mdash;you have gained power in one direction, but you have lost
      it in another! You cannot have your cake, and eat it!" Here he reeled
      against the wall,&mdash;then straightening himself with a curious effort
      at dignity, he continued: "Leave her alone, Sergius! Leave Lotys in peace!
      She is a good soul! Let her love where she will and how she will,&mdash;she
      has the right to choose her lover,&mdash;the right!&mdash;by Heaven!&mdash;it
      is a right denied to no woman! And if she has chosen the King, she is only
      one of many who have done the same!"
    </p>
    <p>
      With a smothered sound between a curse and a groan, Thord suddenly wheeled
      round away from him and left him. Vaguely surprised, yet too stupefied to
      realise that his rambling words might have worked serious mischief, Zouche
      gazed blinkingly on his retreating figure.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The same old story!" he muttered, with a foolish laugh; "Always a woman
      in it! He has won leadership and power,&mdash;he has secured the
      friendship of a King,&mdash;but if the King is his rival in matters of
      love&mdash;ah!&mdash;that is a worse danger for the Throne than the spread
      of Socialism!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He rambled off unthinkingly, and gave the only part of him which remained
      still active, his poetic instinct, up to the composition of a delicate
      love-song, which he wrote between two taverns and several drinks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Late in the afternoon&mdash;just after sundown&mdash;a small close
      brougham drove up to the corner of the street where stood the tenement
      house,&mdash;divided into several separate flats,&mdash;in which the attic
      where Lotys dwelt was one of the most solitary and removed portions. The
      King alighted from the carriage unobserved, and ascended the stairs on
      which Sergius Thord's steps had echoed but a few hours gone by. Knocking
      at the door as Sergius had done, he was in the same way bidden to enter,
      but as he did so, Lotys, who was seated within, quite alone, started up
      with a faint cry of terror.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You here!" she exclaimed in trembling accents; "Oh, why, why have you
      come! Sir, I beg of you to leave this place!&mdash;at once, before there
      is any chance of your being seen; your Majesty should surely know&mdash;&mdash;!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Majesty me no majesties, Lotys!" said the King, lightly; "I have been
      forbidden this little shrine too long! Why should I not come to see you?
      Are you not known as an angel of comfort to the sorrowful and the lonely?&mdash;and
      will you not impart such consolation to me, as I may, in my many griefs
      deserve? Nay, Lotys, Lotys! No tears!&mdash;no tears, dearest of women! To
      see you weep is the only thing that could possibly unman me, and make even
      'Pasquin Leroy' lose his nerve!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He approached her, and sought to take her hand, but she turned away from
      him, and he saw her bosom heave with a passion of repressed weeping.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lotys!" he then said, with exceeding gentleness; "What is this? Why are
      you unhappy? I have written to you every day since that night when your
      lips clung to mine for one glad moment,&mdash;I have poured out my soul to
      you with more or less eloquence, and surely with passion!&mdash;every day
      I have prayed you to receive me, and yet you have vouchsafed no reply to
      one who is by your own confession 'the only man you love'! Ah, Lotys!&mdash;you
      will not now deny that sweet betrayal of your heart! Do you know that was
      the happiest day of my life?&mdash;the day on which I was threatened by
      Death, and saved by Love!"
    </p>
    <p>
      His mellow voice thrilled with its underlying tenderness;&mdash;he caught
      her hand and kissed it; but she was silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      With all the yearning passion which had been pent up in him for many
      months, he studied the pure outlines of her brow and throat&mdash;the
      falling sunlight glow of her hair&mdash;the deep azure glory of the
      pitying eyes, half veiled beneath their golden lashes, and just now
      sparkling with tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      "All my life," he said softly, still holding her hand; "I have longed for
      love! All my life I have lacked it! Can you imagine, then, what it was to
      me, Lotys, when I heard you say you loved my Resemblance,&mdash;the poor
      Pasquin Leroy!&mdash;and even so I knew you loved me? When you praised me
      as Pasquin, and cursed me as King, how my heart burned with desire to
      clasp you in my arms, and tell you all the truth of my disguise! But to
      hear you speak as you did of me, so unconsciously, so tenderly, so
      bravely, was the sweetest gladness I have ever known! I felt myself a king
      at last, in very deed and truth!&mdash;and it was for the love of you, and
      because of your love for me, that I determined to do all I could for my
      son Humphry, and the woman of his choice! For, finding myself loved, I
      swore that he should not be deprived of love. I have done what I could to
      ensure his happiness; but after all, it is your doing, and the result of
      your influence! You are the sole centre of my good deeds, Lotys!&mdash;you
      have been my star of destiny from the very first day I saw you!&mdash;from
      the moment when I signed my bond with you in your own pure blood, I loved
      you! And I know that you loved me!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned her eyes slowly upon him,&mdash;what eyes!&mdash;tearless now,
      and glittering with the burning fever of the sad and suffering soul behind
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You forget!" she said in hushed, trembling accents; "You are the King!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He lifted her hand to his lips again, and pressed its cool small palm
      against his brows.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What then, my dearest? Must the King, because he is King, go through life
      unloved?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Unless the King is loved with honour," said Lotys in the same hushed
      voice; "He must go unloved!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He dropped her hand and looked at her. She was very pale&mdash;her breath
      came and went quickly, but her eyes were fixed upon him steadily,&mdash;and
      though her whole heart cried out for his sympathy and tenderness, she did
      not flinch.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lotys!" he said; "Are you so cold, so frozen in an ice-wall of
      conventionality that you cannot warm to passion&mdash;not even to that
      passion which every pulse of you is ready to return? What do you want of
      me? Lover's oaths? Vows of constancy? Oh, beloved woman as you are, do you
      not understand that you have entered into my very heart of hearts&mdash;that
      you hold my whole life in your possession? You&mdash;not I&mdash;are the
      ruling power of this country! What you say, that I will do! What you
      command, that will I obey! While you live, I will live&mdash;when you die,
      I will die! Through you I have learned the value of sovereignty,&mdash;the
      good that can be done to a country by honest work in kingship,&mdash;through
      you I have won back my disaffected subjects to loyalty;&mdash;it is all
      you&mdash;only you! And if you blamed me once as a worthless king, you
      shall never have cause to so blame me again! But you must help me,&mdash;you
      must help me with your love!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She strove to control the beating of her heart, as she looked upon him and
      listened to his pleading. She resolutely shut her soul to the persuasive
      music of his voice, the light of his eyes, the tenderness of his smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What of the Queen?" she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      He started back, as though he had been stung.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Queen!" he repeated, mechanically&mdash;"The Queen!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ay, the Queen!" said Lotys. "She is your wife&mdash;the mother of your
      sons! She has never loved you, you would say,&mdash;you have never loved
      her. But you are her husband! Would you make me your mistress?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Her voice was calm. She put the plain question point-blank, without a note
      of hesitation. His face paled suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lotys!" he said, and stretched out his hands towards her; "Lotys, I love
      you!"
    </p>
    <p>
      A change passed over her,&mdash;rapid and transfiguring as a sudden
      radiance from heaven. With an impulsive gesture, beautiful in its wild
      abandonment, she cast herself at his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And I love you!" she said. "I love you with every breath of my body,
      every pulse of my heart! I love you with the entire passion of my life! I
      love you with all the love pent up in my poor starved soul since childhood
      until now!&mdash;I love you more than woman ever loved either lover or
      husband! I love you, my lord and King!&mdash;but even as I love you, I
      honour you! No selfish thought of mine shall ever tarnish the smallest
      jewel in your Crown! Oh, my beloved! My Royal soul of courage! What do you
      take me for? Should I be worthy of your thought if I dragged you down?
      Should I be Lotys,&mdash;if, like some light woman who can be bought for a
      few jewels,&mdash;I gave myself to you in that fever of desire which men
      mistake for love? Ah, no!&mdash;ten thousand times no! I love you! Look at
      me,&mdash;can you not see how my soul cries out for you? How my lips
      hunger for your kisses&mdash;how I long, ah, God! for all the tenderness
      which I know is in your heart for me,&mdash;I, so lonely, weary, and
      robbed of all the dearest joys of life!&mdash;but I will not shame you by
      my love, my best and dearest! I will not set you one degree lower in the
      thoughts of the People, who now idolise you and know you as the brave,
      true man you are! My love for you would be poor indeed, if I could not
      sacrifice myself altogether for your sake,&mdash;you, who are my King!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He heard her,&mdash;his whole soul was shaken by the passion of her words.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lotys!" he said,&mdash;and again&mdash;"Lotys!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He drew her up from her kneeling attitude, and gathering her close in his
      arms, kissed her tenderly, reverently&mdash;as a man might kiss the lips
      of the dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Must it be so, Lotys?" he whispered; "Must we dwell always apart?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes, beautiful with a passion of the highest and holiest love, looked
      full into his.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Always apart, yet always together, my beloved!" she answered; "Together
      in thought, in soul, in aspiration!&mdash;in the hope and confidence that
      God sees us, and knows that we seek to live purely in His sight! Oh, my
      King, you would not have it otherwise! You would not have our love
      defiled! How common and easy it would be for me to give myself to you!&mdash;as
      other women are only too ready to give themselves,&mdash;to take your
      tenderness, your care, your admiration,&mdash;to demand your constant
      attendance on my lightest humour!&mdash;to bring you shame by my
      persistent companionship!&mdash;to cause an open slander, and allow the
      finger of scorn to be pointed at you!&mdash;to see your honour made a
      mockery of, by base, persons who would judge you as one, who,
      notwithstanding his brave espousal of the People's Cause, was yet a slave
      to the caprice of a woman! Think something more of me than this! Do not
      put me on the level of such women as once brought your name into contempt!
      They did not love you!&mdash;they loved themselves! But I&mdash;I love
      you! Oh, my dearest lord, if self were concerned at all in this great love
      of my heart, I would not suffer your arms to rest about me now!&mdash;I
      would not let your lips touch mine!&mdash;but it is for the last time,
      beloved!&mdash;the last time! And so I put my hands here on your heart&mdash;I
      kiss your lips&mdash;I say with all my soul in the prayer&mdash;God bless
      you!&mdash;God keep you!&mdash;God save you, my King! Though I shall live
      apart from you all my days, my spirit is one with yours! God will know
      that truth when we meet&mdash;on the other side of Death!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Her tears fell fast, and he bent over her, torn by a tempest of
      conflicting emotions, and kissing the soft hair that lay loosely ruffled
      against his breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then it shall be so, Lotys!" he murmured, at last. "Your wish is my law!&mdash;it
      shall be as you command! I will fulfil such duties as I must in this
      world,&mdash;and the knowledge of your love for me,&mdash;your trust in
      me,&mdash;shall keep me high in the People's honour! Old follies shall be
      swept away&mdash;old sins atoned for;&mdash;and when we meet, as you say,
      on the other side of Death, God will perchance give us all that we have
      longed for in this world&mdash;all that we have lost!"
    </p>
    <p>
      His voice shook,&mdash;he could not further rely on his self-control.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will not tempt you, Lotys!" he whispered&mdash;"I dare not tempt
      myself! God bless you!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He put her gently from him, and stood for a moment irresolute. All the
      hope he had indulged in of a sweeter joy than any he had ever known, was
      lost,&mdash;and yet&mdash;he knew he had no right to press upon her a love
      which, to her, could only mean dishonour.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good-bye, Lotys!" he said, huskily; "My one love in this world and the
      next! Good-bye!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She gazed at him with her whole soul in her eyes,&mdash;then suddenly, and
      with the tenderest grace in the world, dropped on her knees and kissed his
      hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "God save your Majesty!" she said, with a poor little effort at smiling
      through her tears; "For many and many a long and happy year, when Lotys is
      no more!"
    </p>
    <p>
      With a half cry he snatched her up in his arms and pressed her to his
      heart, showering kisses on her lips, her eyes, her hair, her little hands!&mdash;then,
      with a movement as abrupt as it was passion-stricken, put her quickly from
      him and left her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She listened with straining ears to the quick firm echo of his footsteps
      departing from her, and echoing down the stairs. She caught the ring of
      his tread on the pavement outside. She heard the grinding roll of the
      wheels of his carriage as he was rapidly driven away. He had gone! As she
      realised this, her courage suddenly failed her, and sinking down beside
      the chair in which he had for a moment sat, she laid her head upon it, and
      wept long and bitterly. Her conscience told her that she had done well,
      but her heart&mdash;the starving woman's heart,&mdash;was all unsatisfied,
      and clamoured for its dearest right&mdash;love! And she had of her own
      will, her own choice, put love aside,&mdash;the most precious, the most
      desired love in the world!&mdash;she had sent it away out of her life for
      ever! True, she could call it back, if she chose with a word&mdash;but she
      knew that for the sake of a king, and a country's honour, she would not so
      call it back! She might have said with one of the most human of poets:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  "Will someone say, then why not ill for good?
  Why took ye not
your pastime? To that man  My word shall answer, since I knew the Right
  And did it." [Footnote: Tennyson ]
</pre>
    <p>
      A shadowy form moving uncertainly to and fro near the corner of the
      street, appeared to spring forward and to falter back again, as the King,
      hurriedly departing, glanced up and down the street once or twice as
      though in doubt or questioning, and then walked to his brougham. The soft
      hues of a twilight sky, in which the stars were beginning to appear, fell
      on his face and showed it ashy pale; but he was absorbed in his own sad
      and bitter thoughts,&mdash;lost in his own inward contemplation of the
      love which consumed him,&mdash;and he saw nothing of that hidden watcher
      in the semi-gloom, gazing at him with such fierce eyes of hate as might
      have intimidated even the bravest man. He entered his carriage and was
      rapidly driven away, and the shadow,&mdash;no other than Sergius Thord,&mdash;stumbling
      forward,&mdash;his brain on fire, and a loaded pistol in his hand,&mdash;had
      hardly realised his presence before he was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why did I not kill him?" he muttered, amazed at his own hesitation; "He
      stood here, close to me! It would have been so easy!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He remained another moment or two gazing around him at the streets, at the
      roofs, at the sky, as though in a wondering dream,&mdash;then all at once,
      it seemed as if every cell in his brain had suddenly become superhumanly
      active. His eyes flashed fury,&mdash;and turning swiftly into the house
      which the King had just left, he ran madly up the stairs as though
      impelled by a whirlwind, and burst without bidding, straight into the room
      where Lotys still knelt, weeping. At the noise of his entrance she started
      up, the tears wet on her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sergius!" she cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at her, breathing heavily.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes,&mdash;Sergius!" he said, his voice sounding thick and husky, and
      unlike itself. "I am Sergius! Or I was Sergius, before you made of me a
      nameless devil! And you&mdash;you are Lotys!&mdash;you are weeping for the
      lover who has just parted from you! You are Lotys&mdash;the mistress of
      the King!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She made him no answer. Drawing herself up to her full height, she flashed
      upon him a look of utter scorn, and maintained a contemptuous silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mistress of the King!" he repeated, speaking in hard gasps; "You,&mdash;Lotys,&mdash;have
      come to this! You,&mdash;the spotless Angel of our Cause! You!&mdash;why,&mdash;I
      sicken at the sight of you! Oh, you fulfil thoroughly the mission of your
      sex!&mdash;which is to dupe and betray men! You were the traitor all
      along! You knew the real identity of 'Pasquin Leroy'! He was your lover
      from the first,&mdash;and to him you handed the secrets of the Committee,
      and played Us into his hands! It was well done&mdash;cleverly done!&mdash;woman's
      work in all its best cunning!&mdash;but treachery does not always pay!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Amazed and indignant, she boldly confronted him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You must be mad, Sergius! What do you mean? What sudden accusations are
      these? You know they are false&mdash;why do you utter them?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He sprang towards her, and seized her roughly by the arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How do I know they are false?" he said. "Prove to me they are false! Who
      saved the King's life? You! And why? Because you knew he was 'Pasquin
      Leroy'! How was it he gained such swift ascendancy over all our Committee,
      and led the work and swayed the men,&mdash;and made of me his tool and
      servant? Through you again! And why? Because you knew he was the King! Why
      have you scorned me&mdash;turned from me&mdash;thrust me from your side&mdash;denied
      my love,&mdash;though I have loved and cared for you from childhood! Why,
      I say? Because you love the King!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She stood perfectly still,&mdash;unmoved by his frantic manner&mdash;by
      the glare of his bloodshot eyes, and his irrepressible agony of rage and
      jealousy. Quietly she glanced him up and down.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are right!" she said tranquilly; "I do love the King!"
    </p>
    <p>
      A horrible oath broke from his lips, and for a moment his face grew
      crimson with the rising blood that threatened to choke the channels of his
      brain. An anxious pity softened her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sergius!" she said gently, "You are not yourself&mdash;you rave&mdash;you
      do not know what you say! What has maddened you? What have I done? You
      know my life is free&mdash;I have a right to do with it as I will, and
      even as my life is free, so is my love! I cannot love where I am bidden&mdash;I
      must love where Love itself calls!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood still, staring at her. He seemed to have lost the power of
      speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have insulted me almost beyond pardon!" she went on. "Your
      accusations are all lies! I love the King,&mdash;but I am not the King's
      mistress! I would no more be his mistress than I would be your wife!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Slowly, slowly, his hand got at something in his pocket and clutched it
      almost unconsciously. Slowly, slowly, he raised that hand, still clutching
      that something,&mdash;and his lips parted in a breathless way, showing the
      wolfish glimmer of white teeth within.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You&mdash;love&mdash;the King!" he said in deliberate accents. "And you
      dare&mdash;you dare to tell me so?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She raised her golden head with a beautiful defiance and courage.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I love the King!" she said&mdash;"And I dare to tell you so!"
    </p>
    <p>
      With a lightning quickness of movement the hand that had been groping
      after an unseen evil now came out into the light, with a sudden sharp
      crash, and flame of fire!
    </p>
    <p>
      A faint cry tore the air.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah&mdash;Sergius!&mdash;Sergius! Oh&mdash;God!"
    </p>
    <p>
      And Lotys staggered back&mdash;stunned, deafened&mdash;sick, dizzy&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Death, death!" she thought, wildly; "This is death!"
    </p>
    <p>
      And, with a last desperate rallying of her sinking force, as every memory
      of her life swept over her brain in that supreme moment, she sprang at her
      murderer and wrenched the weapon from his hand, clutching it hard and fast
      in her own.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Say&mdash;say I did it&mdash;myself&mdash;!" she gasped, in short quick
      sobs of pain; "Tell the King&mdash;I did it myself&mdash;myself! Sergius&mdash;save
      your own life!&mdash;I&mdash;forgive!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She reeled, and with a choking cry fell back heavily&mdash;dead! Her hair
      came unbound with her fall, and shook itself round her in a gold wave, as
      though to hide the horror of the oozing blood that trickled from her lips
      and breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a horrid sense of unreality Thord stared upon the evil he had done.
      He gazed stupidly around him. He listened for someone to come and explain
      to him what had happened. But up in that remote attic, there was no one to
      hear either a pistol-shot or a cry. There was only one thing to be
      understood and learnt by heart,&mdash;that Lotys, once living, was now
      dead! Dead! How came she dead? That was what he could not determine. The
      heat of his wild fury had passed,&mdash;leaving him cold and passive as a
      stone.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lotys!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He whispered the name. Horrible! How she looked,&mdash;with all that
      blood!&mdash;all that golden hair!
    </p>
    <p>
      'Tell the King I did it myself!' Yes&mdash;the King would have to be told&mdash;something!
      Stooping, he tried to detach the pistol from the lifeless hand, but the
      fingers, though still warm were tightened on the weapon, and he dared not
      unclasp them. He was afraid! He stood up again, and looked around him. His
      glance fell on the knot of regal flowers he had noticed in the morning,&mdash;the
      great roses,&mdash;the voluptuous orchids&mdash;tied with their golden
      ribbon. He took them hastily and flung them down beside her,&mdash;then
      watched a little trickling stream of blood running, running towards one of
      the whitest and purest of the roses. It reached it, stained it,&mdash;and
      presently drowned it in a little pool. Horrified, he covered his eyes, and
      staggered backward against the door. The evening was growing dark,&mdash;through
      the small high window he could see the stars beginning to shine as usual.
      As usual,&mdash;though Lotys was dead! That seemed strange! Putting one
      hand behind him, he cautiously opened the door, still keeping his guarded
      gaze on that huddled heap of clothes, and blood, and glittering hair which
      had been Lotys.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I must get home," he muttered. "I have business to attend to&mdash;as
      Deputy to the city, there is much to do&mdash;much to do for the People!
      The People! My God! And Lotys dead!"
    </p>
    <p>
      A kind of hysteric laughter threatened him. He pressed his mouth hard with
      his hand to choke back this strange, struggling passion.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lotys! Lotys is dead! There she lies! Someone, I know not who, killed
      her! No,&mdash;no! She has killed herself,&mdash;she said so! There she
      lies, poor Lotys! She will never speak to the People&mdash;never comfort
      them,&mdash;never teach them any more&mdash;never hold little motherless
      infants in her arms and console them,&mdash;never smile on the sorrowful,
      or cheer the sick&mdash;never! 'I love the King!' she said,&mdash;and she
      died for saying it! One should not love kings! 'Tell the King I did it
      myself!' Yes, Lotys!&mdash;lie still&mdash;be at peace&mdash;the King
      shall know&mdash;soon enough!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Still muttering uneasily to himself, he went out, always moving backwards&mdash;and
      with a last look at that fallen breathless form of murdered woman, shut
      the door stealthily behind him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, stumbling giddily down the stairs, he wandered, blind and half
      crazed, into the darkening night.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXIII. &mdash; SAILING TO THE INFINITE
    </h2>
    <p>
      Great calamities always come suddenly. With the swiftness of lightning
      they descend upon the world, often in the very midst of fancied peace and
      security,&mdash;and the farcical, grinning, sneering apes of humanity, for
      whom even the idea of a God has but furnished food for lewd jesting, are
      scattered into terror-stricken hordes, who are forced to realise for the
      first time in their lives, that whether they believe in Omnipotence or no,
      an evident Law of Justice exists, which may not be outraged with impunity.
      Sometimes this Law works strangely,&mdash;one might almost say obliquely.
      It sweeps away persons whom we have judged as useful to the community, and
      allows those to remain whom we consider unnecessary. But 'we,'&mdash;all
      important 'we,'&mdash;are not allowed to long assert or maintain our petty
      opinions against this unknown undetermined Force which makes havoc of all
      our best and most carefully conceived arrangements. For example, we are
      not given any practical reason why Christ,&mdash;the Divine Man,&mdash;was
      taken from the world in His youthful manhood, instead of being permitted
      to live to a great age for the further benefit, teaching, and
      sanctification of His disciples and followers. Pure, sinless, noble, and
      truly of God, He was tortured and crucified as though He were the worst of
      criminals. And apart from the Church's explanation of this great Mystery,
      we may take it as a lesson that misfortune is like everything else,
      two-sided;&mdash;it falls equally upon the ungodly and the godly,&mdash;with
      merely this difference&mdash;that when it falls on the ungodly it is, as
      we are reluctantly forced to admit, 'the act of God'&mdash;but when it
      falls on the godly, it is generally the proved and evident work of Man.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this last way, and for no fault at all of her own, had cruel death
      befallen Lotys. Such as her career had been, it was unmarked by so much as
      a shadow of selfishness or wickedness. From the first day of her life,
      sorrow had elected her for its own. She had never known father or mother;&mdash;cast
      out as an infant in the street, and picked up by Sergius Thord, she had
      secured no other protector for her infancy and youth, than the brooding,
      introspective man, who was destined in the end to be her murderer. As a
      child, she had been passionately grateful to him; she had learned all she
      could from the books he gave her to study, and with a quick brain, and a
      keen sense of observation, she had become a proficient in literature, so
      much so indeed, that more than one half the Revolutionary treatises and
      other propaganda which he had sent out to different quarters of the globe,
      were from her pen. Her one idea had been to please and to serve him,&mdash;to
      show her gratitude for his care of her, and to prove herself useful to him
      in all his aims. As she grew up, however, she quickly discerned that his
      affection for her was deepening into the passion of a lover; whereupon she
      had at once withdrawn from his personal charge, and had made up her mind
      to live alone and independently. She desired, so she told him, to subsist
      on her own earnings,&mdash;and he who could do nothing successfully
      without her, was only too glad to give her the rightful share of such
      financial results as accrued from the various workings of the
      Revolutionary Committee,&mdash;results which were sometimes considerable,
      though never opulent. And so she had worked on, finding her best happiness
      in succouring the poor, and nursing the sick. Her girlhood had passed
      without either joy or love,&mdash;her womanhood had been bare of all the
      happiness that should have graced it. The people had learned to love her,
      it is true,&mdash;but this more or less distantly felt affection was far
      from being the intimate and near love for which she had so often longed.
      When at last this love had come to her,&mdash;when in 'Pasquin Leroy' she
      thought she had found the true companion of her life and heart,&mdash;when
      he had constantly accompanied her by his own choice, on her errands of
      mercy among the poor; and had aided the sick and the distressed by his own
      sympathy and tenderness, she had almost allowed herself to dream of
      possible happiness. This dream had been encouraged more than ever, after
      she had saved the King from assassination. 'Pasquin Leroy' had then become
      her closest comrade,&mdash;always at hand, and ever ready to fulfil her
      slightest behest;&mdash;while from his ardent and eloquent glances,&mdash;the
      occasional lingering pressure of his hand, and the hastily murmured words
      of tenderness which she could not misunderstand, she knew that he loved
      her. But when he had disclosed his real identity to be that of the King
      himself, all her fair hopes had vanished!&mdash;and her spirit had shrunk
      and fallen under the blow. Worse than all,&mdash;when she learned that
      this great and exalted Personage, despite his throned dignity, did still
      continue to entertain a passion for herself, the knowledge was almost
      crushing in its effect upon her mind. Pure in soul and body, she would
      have chosen death any time rather than dishonour; and in the recent
      developments of events she had sometimes grown to consider death as good,
      and even desirable. Now death had come to her through the very hand that
      had first aided her to live! And so had she fulfilled the common lot of
      women, which is, taken in the aggregate, to be wronged and slain (morally,
      when not physically) by the very men they have most unselfishly sought to
      serve!
    </p>
    <p>
      The heavy night passed away, and all through its slow hours the murdered
      creature lay weltering in her blood, and shrouded in her hair,&mdash;looked
      at by the pitiless stars and the cold moon, as they shed their beams in
      turn through the high attic window. Morning broke; and the sun shot its
      first rays down upon the dead,&mdash;upon the fixed white countenance, and
      on the little hand grown icy cold, but clenched with iron grip upon the
      pistol which had been so bravely snatched in that last moment of life with
      the unselfish thought of averting suspicion from the true murderer. With
      the full break of day, the mistress of the house going to arouse her
      lodgers, came up the stairs with a bright face, cheerfully singing, for
      her usual morning chat with Lotys was one of her principal pleasures.
      Knocking at the door, and receiving no answer, she turned the handle and
      pushed it open,&mdash;then, with a piercing scream of horror, she rushed
      away, calling wildly for help, and sending frantic cries down the street.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lotys! Lotys! Lotys is dead!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The news flew. The houses poured out their poverty-stricken occupants from
      garret to basement; and presently the street was blocked with a stupefied,
      grief-stricken crowd. A doctor who had been hastily summoned, lifted the
      poor corpse of her whose life had been all love and pity, and laid it upon
      the simple truckle-bed, where the living Lotys had slept, contented with
      poverty for many years; and after close and careful examination pronounced
      it to be a case of suicide. The word created consternation among all the
      people.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Suicide!" they murmured uneasily; "Why should she kill herself? We all
      loved her!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Ay! They all loved her!&mdash;and only now when she was gone did they
      realise how great that love had been, or how much her thought and
      tenderness for them all, had been interwoven with their lives! They had
      never stopped to think of the weariness and emptiness of her own life, or
      of the longing she herself might have had for the love and care she so
      freely gave to others. By and by, as the terrible news was borne in upon
      them more convincingly, some began to weep and wail, others to kneel and
      pray, others to recall little kindnesses, thoughtful deeds, unselfish
      tendernesses, and patient endurances of the dead woman who, friendless
      herself, had been their truest friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who will tell Sergius Thord?" asked a man in the crowd; "Who will break
      the news to him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      There was an awe-stricken silence. No one volunteered such heart-rending
      service.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who will tell the King?" suddenly exclaimed a harsh voice, that of Paul
      Zouche, who in his habit of hardly ever going to bed, had seen the crowd
      gather, and had quickly joined it. "Lotys saved his life! He should be
      told!"
    </p>
    <p>
      His face, always remarkable in its thin, eager, intellectual aspect,
      looked ghastly, and his eyes no longer feverish in their brilliancy, were
      humanised by the dew of tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The King!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The weeping people looked at one another. The King had now become a part
      of their life and interest,&mdash;he was one with them, not apart from
      them as once he had been; therefore he must have known how Lotys had loved
      them. Yes,&mdash;someone should surely tell the King!
    </p>
    <p>
      "The King must be informed of this," went on Zouche; "If there is no one
      else to take the news to him,&mdash;I will!"
    </p>
    <p>
      And before any answer could be given, or any suggestion made, he was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, no person volunteered to fetch Sergius Thord. Every man who
      knew him, dreaded the task of telling him that Lotys was dead, self-slain.
      Some poor, but tender-hearted women sorrowfully prepared the corpse for
      burial, removing the bloodstained clothes with gentle hands, smoothing out
      and parting on either side the glorious waves of hair, while with the
      greatest care and difficulty they succeeded by slow degrees in removing
      the pistol so tightly clenched in the dead hand. While engaged in this sad
      duty, they found a sealed paper marked 'My Last Wish,' and this they put
      aside till Thord should come. Then they robed her in white, and laid white
      flowers upon her breast; and so came in turns by groups of tens and
      twenties to kneel beside her and kiss her hands and say prayers, and weep
      for the loss of one who had never uttered a harsh word to any poor or
      sorrowful person, but whose mission had been peace and healing, love and
      resignation, and submission to her own hard fate until the end!
    </p>
    <p>
      Meantime Zouche, who had never been near any Royal precincts before,
      walked boldly to the Palace. All irresolution had left him;&mdash;his step
      was firm, his manner self-contained, and only his eyes betrayed the deep
      and bitter sorrow of his soul. He was allowed to pass the sentinel at the
      outer gates, but at the inner portico of the Palace he was denied
      admittance. He maintained his composure, however, and handed in his
      written name.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If I cannot see the King, I must see Sir Roger de Launay!" he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this the men in authority glanced at one another, and began to unbend;&mdash;if
      this shabby, untidy being knew Sir Roger de Launay, he was perhaps someone
      of importance. After a brief consultation together, they asked him to wait
      while a messenger was despatched to Sir Roger.
    </p>
    <p>
      Zouche, with a curious air of passive toleration sat quietly on the chair
      they offered, and waited several minutes glancing meanwhile at the display
      of splendour and luxury about him with an indifference bordering on
      contempt.
    </p>
    <p>
      "All this magnificence," he mused; "all this wealth cannot purchase back a
      life, or bring comfort to a stricken heart! Nor can it vie with a poet's
      rhyme, which, often unvalued, and always unpaid for, sometimes outlasts a
      thousand thrones!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Here, seeing the tall figure of Sir Roger de Launay coming between him and
      the light, he rose and advanced a step or two.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, Zouche," said Sir Roger kindly, greeting him with a smile; "You are
      up betimes! They tell me you want to see the King. Is it not a somewhat
      early call? His Majesty has only just left his sleeping-apartment, and is
      busy writing urgent letters. Will you entrust me with your message?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Paul Zouche looked at him fixedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My message is from Lotys!" he said deliberately; "And it must be
      delivered to the King in person!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Vaguely alarmed, Sir Roger recoiled a step.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You bring ill news?" he whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do not know whether it will prove ill or well;" answered Zouche
      wearily; "But such news as I have, must be told to his Majesty alone."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Roger paused a moment, hesitating; then he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "If that is so&mdash;if that must be so,&mdash;then come with me!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He led the way, and Zouche followed. Entering the King's private library
      where the King himself sat at his writing-desk, Sir Roger announced the
      unexpected visitor, adding in a low tone that he came 'from Lotys!'
    </p>
    <p>
      The King started up, and threw down his pen.
    </p>
    <p>
      "From Lotys!" he echoed, while through his mind there flew a sudden sweet
      hope that after all the star was willing to fall!&mdash;the flower was
      ready to be gathered!&mdash;and that the woman who had sent him away from
      her the day before, had a heart too full of love to remain obdurate to the
      pleadings of her kingly lover!&mdash;"Paul Zouche, with a message from
      Lotys? Let him come in!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Whereupon Zouche, bidden to enter, did so, and stood in the Royal presence
      unabashed, but quite silent. An ominous presentiment crept coldly through
      the monarch's warm veins, as he saw the dreary pain expressed on the
      features of the man, who had so persistently scorned him and his offered
      bounty,&mdash;and with a slight, but imperative sign, he dismissed Sir
      Roger de Launay, who retired reluctantly, full of forebodings.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now Zouche," he said gently; "What do you seek of me? What is your
      message?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Zouche looked full at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "As King," he answered, "I seek nothing from you! As comrade"&mdash;and
      his accents faltered&mdash;"I would fain break bad news to you gently&mdash;I
      would spare you as much as possible&mdash;and give you time to face the
      blow,&mdash;for I know you loved her! Lotys&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      The monarch's heart almost stood still. What was this hesitating tone&mdash;these
      great tears in Zouche's eyes?
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lotys!" he repeated slowly, and in a faint whisper; "Yes, yes&mdash;go
      on! Go on, comrade! Lotys?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lotys is dead!"
    </p>
    <p>
      An awful stillness followed the words. Stiff and rigid the King sat, as
      though stricken by sudden paralysis, giving no sign. Minute after minute
      slipped away,&mdash;and he uttered not a word, nor did he raise his eyes
      from the fixed study of the carpet at his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lotys is dead!" went on Zouche, speaking in a slow monotonous way. "This
      morning, the first thing&mdash;they found her. She had killed herself. The
      pistol was in her hand. And they are laying her out with flowers,&mdash;like
      a bride, or a queen,&mdash;and you can go and see her at rest so,&mdash;for
      the last time,&mdash;if you will! This is my message! It is a message from
      the dead!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Still the King spoke not a word; nor did he lift his eyes from his
      brooding observation of the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      "To be a great King, as you are," said Zouche; "And yet to be unable to
      keep alive a love when you have won it, is a hard thing! She must have
      killed herself for your sake!"
    </p>
    <p>
      No answer was vouchsafed to him. He began to feel a strange pity for that
      solemn, upright figure, sitting there inflexibly silent,&mdash;and he
      approached it a little nearer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Comrade!" he said softly; "I have hated you as a King! Yes, I have always
      hated you!&mdash;even when I found you had played the part of 'Pasquin
      Leroy,' and had worked for our Cause, and had helped to make what is now
      called my 'fame'! I hated you,&mdash;because through it all, and whatever
      you did for me, or for others, it seemed to me you had never known hunger
      and cold and want!&mdash;never known what it was to have love snatched
      away from you! I watched the growth of your passion for Lotys&mdash;I knew
      she loved you!&mdash;and had you indeed been the poor writer and thinker
      you assumed to be, all might have been well for you both! But when you
      declared yourself to be King, what could there be for such a woman but
      death? She would never have chosen dishonour! She has taken the straight
      way out of trouble, but&mdash;but she has left <i>you</i> alone! And I am
      sorry for you! I know what it is&mdash;to be left alone! You have a palace
      here, adorned with all the luxuries that wealth can buy, and yet you are
      alone in it! I too have a palace,&mdash;a palace of thought, furnished
      with ideals and dreams which no wealth can buy; and I am alone in it too!
      I killed the woman who loved me best; and you have done the same, in your
      way! It is the usual trick of men,&mdash;to kill the women who love them
      best, and then to be sorry for ever afterwards!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He drew still nearer&mdash;then very slowly, very hesitatingly, dropped on
      one knee, and ventured to kiss the monarch's passive hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My comrade! My King! I am sorry for you now!"
    </p>
    <p>
      For answer, his own hand was suddenly caught in a fierce convulsive grip,
      and the King rose stiffly erect. His features were grey and drawn, his
      lips were bloodless, his eyes glittering, as with fever. Stricken to the
      heart as he was, he yet forced himself to find voice and utterance.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Speak again, Zouche! Speak those horrible, horrible words again! Make me
      feel them to be true! Lotys is dead!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Zouche, with something like fear for the visible, yet strongly suppressed
      anguish of the man before him, sighed drearily as he repeated&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lotys is dead! It is God's way&mdash;to kill all beautiful things, just
      as we have learned to love them! She,&mdash;Lotys,&mdash;used to talk of
      Justice and Order,&mdash;poor soul!&mdash;she never found either! Yet she
      believed in God!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The King's stern face never relaxed in its frozen rigidity of woe. Only
      his lips moved mutteringly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dead! Lotys! My God!&mdash;my God! To rise to such a height of hope and
      good&mdash;and then&mdash;to fall so low! Lotys gone from me!&mdash;and
      with her goes all!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Then a sudden delirious hurry seemed to take possession of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Go now, Zouche!" he said impatiently&mdash;"Go back to the place where
      she lies&mdash;and tell her I am coming! I must&mdash;I will see her
      again! And I will see you again, Zouche!&mdash;you too!" He forced a pale
      smile&mdash;"Yes, poor poet! I will see you and speak with you of this&mdash;you
      shall write for her a dirge!&mdash;a threnody of passion and regret that
      shall make the whole world weep! Poor Zouche!&mdash;you have had a hard
      life&mdash;well may you wonder why God made us men! And Lotys is dead!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He rang the bell on his desk violently. Sir Roger de Launay at once
      returned,&mdash;but started back at the sight of his Royal master's
      altered countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have the kindness, De Launay"&mdash;said the King hurriedly, not heeding
      his dismayed looks&mdash;"to place a carriage at the disposal of our
      friend Zouche! He has much business to do;&mdash;sad news to bear to all
      the quarters of the city&mdash;he will tell you of it,&mdash;as he has
      just told me! Lotys,&mdash;you know her!&mdash;Lotys, who saved my life at
      the risk of her own,&mdash;Lotys is dead!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Roger recoiled with an ejaculation of horror and pity.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is sudden&mdash;and&mdash;and strange!" continued the King, still
      speaking in the same rapid manner, and beginning to push aside the various
      letters and documents on his table&mdash;"It is a kind of darkness fallen
      without warning!&mdash;but&mdash;such tragedies always do happen thus&mdash;unpreparedly!
      Lotys was a grand creature,&mdash;a noble and self-sacrificing woman&mdash;the
      poor will miss her&mdash;yes&mdash;the poor will miss her greatly!&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      He broke off, and with a speechless gesture of agonised entreaty,
      intimated that he must be left alone. De Launay hustled Zouche out of the
      apartment in a kind of impotent fury.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why have you brought the King such news?" he demanded&mdash;"It will kill
      him!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He has killed <i>her</i>!" returned Zouche, grimly&mdash;"If he had never
      crossed her path, she would have been alive now! Why should not a King
      suffer like other men? He does the same foolish things,&mdash;he has his
      private loves and hatreds in the same foolish manner,&mdash;why should he
      escape punishment for his follies? It is only in suffering that he grows
      human,&mdash;stripped by grief and pain of his outward pomp and temporal
      power, he even becomes lovable! God save us from this bauble of 'power'!
      It is what Sergius Thord has worked for all his life!&mdash;it is what
      this King claims over his subjects&mdash;and yet&mdash;both monarch and
      reformer would give it all for the life of one woman back again! Look you,
      the King has had a dozen or more mistresses, and Heaven knows how many
      bastards&mdash;but he has only loved once! And it is well that he should
      learn what real love means,&mdash;Sorrow always, and Death often!"
    </p>
    <p>
      That afternoon the whole city knew of the tragic end of Lotys. Nothing
      else was thought of, nothing else talked of. Thousands gathered to look up
      at the house where her body lay, stiffening in the cold grasp of death,
      and a strong body of police were summoned to guard all the approaches to
      the premises, in order to prevent a threatening 'crush' and disaster among
      the increasing crowd, every member of which sought to look for the last
      time on the face of her who had unselfishly served them and loved them in
      their hours of bitterest need. The sight of Sergius Thord passing through
      their midst, with bent head, and ashy, distraught countenance, had not
      pacified the clamorous grief of the people, nor had it elicited such an
      outburst of sympathy for him as one might have thought would have been
      forthcoming. An idea had gotten abroad that since his election as Deputy
      for the city, he had either neglected or set aside the woman who had
      assisted him to gain his position. It was a wrong idea, of course,&mdash;but
      the trifling fact of his having taken up his abode in a more
      'aristocratic' part of the metropolis, while Lotys had still remained in
      the 'quarter of the poor,' was sufficient to give it ground in the minds
      of the ignorant, who are always more or less suspicious of even their best
      friends. Had they made a more ominous guess,&mdash;had they imagined that
      Sergius Thord was the actual murderer of the woman they had idolised,
      there would have been no remembrance whatever of the work he had done to
      aid them in the various reforms now being made for their benefit;&mdash;they
      would have torn him to pieces without a moment's mercy. The rough justice
      of the mob is a terrible thing! It knows nothing of legal phraseology or
      courtesy&mdash;it merely sees an evil deed done, and straightway proceeds
      to punish the evil-doer, regardless of consequences. Happily for the sake
      of peace and order, however, no thought of the truth, no suspicion of the
      real cause of the tragedy occurred to any one person among the
      sorrow-stricken multitude. A faint, half-sobbing cheer went up for the
      King, as his private brougham was recognised, making its way slowly
      through the press of people,&mdash;and it was with a kind of silent awe,
      that they watched his tall figure alight and pass into the house where lay
      the dead. Sergius Thord had already entered there,&mdash;the King and his
      new Deputy would meet! And with uneasy movements, rambling up and down,
      talking of Lotys, of her gentleness, patience and never-wearying sympathy
      for all the suffering and the lonely, the crowds collected, dispersed, and
      collected again,&mdash;every soul among them heavily weighted and
      depressed by the grief and the mystery of death, which though occurring
      every day, still seems the strangest of fates to every mortal born into
      the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meantime, the King with slow reluctant tread, ascended into the room of
      death. Sergius Thord stood there,&mdash;but his brooding face and bulky
      form might have been but a mote of dust in a sunbeam for the little heed
      the stricken monarch took of him. His whole sight, his whole soul were
      concentrated on the white recumbent statue with the autumn-gold hair,
      which was couched in front of him, strewn with flowers. That was Lotys&mdash;or
      rather, that had been Lotys! It was now a very beautiful, still, smiling
      Thing,&mdash;its eyes were shut, but the eyelashes lay delicately on the
      pallid cheeks like little fringes of dark gold, tenderly slumbrous. Those
      eyelashes matched the hair&mdash;the soft, silken hair&mdash;so fine&mdash;so
      lustrous, so warm and bright!&mdash;the hair was surely yet living! With a
      shuddering sigh, the King bent over the piteous sight,&mdash;and stooping
      lower and lower still, touched with trembling lips the small, crossed
      hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he did this, his arm was caught roughly, and Thord thrust him aside.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do not touch her!" he muttered hoarsely&mdash;"Let her rest in peace!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Slowly the King raised his face. It was ashen grey and stricken old. The
      dark, clear, grey eyes were sunken and dim,&mdash;the light of hope,
      ambition, love and endeavour, was quenched in them for ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Was she unhappy, that she killed herself?" he asked, in a hushed voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thord drew back, shuddering. Those sad, lustreless eyes of his Sovereign
      seemed to pierce his soul! He&mdash;the murderer of Lotys&mdash;could not
      face them! A vague whirl of thoughts tormented his brain,&mdash;he had
      heard it said that a murdered person's corpse would bleed in the presence
      of the murderer,&mdash;would the dead body of Lotys bleed now, he wondered
      dully, if he waited long enough? If so&mdash;the King would know! He
      started guiltily, as once more the sad, questioning voice broke on his
      ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Was she unhappy, think you? You knew her better than I!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Huskily, and with dry lips, Thord forced an answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nay, it is possible your Majesty knew her best!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Again the sunken melancholy eyes searched his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She was endowed with genius,&mdash;rich in every good gift of womanhood!
      I would have given my life for hers&mdash;my kingdom to spare her a
      moment's sorrow!" went on the King; "But she would have nothing from me&mdash;nothing!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing,&mdash;not even love!" said Thord recklessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That she had, whether she would or no!"&mdash;replied the King, slowly,&mdash;"That
      she will have, till time itself shall end!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Thord was silent. A passion of mingled fury and remorse consumed him,&mdash;his
      heart was beating rapidly,&mdash;there were great pulsations in his brain
      like heavy hammer-strokes,&mdash;he was afraid of himself, lest on a
      savage impulse he should leap like a beast of prey on this grave composed
      figure,&mdash;this King,&mdash;who was his acknowledged ruler,&mdash;and
      kill him, even as he had killed Lotys! And then,&mdash;he thought of the
      People!&mdash;the People by whose great force and strong justice he had
      sworn to abide!&mdash;the People who had worshipped and applauded him,&mdash;the
      People who, if they ever knew the truth of him and his crime, would snatch
      him up and tear his body to atoms, as surely as he stood branded with
      Murder in God's sight this day! With a powerful effort he rallied his
      forces, and drawing from his breast the small folded paper which had been
      found on the body of Lotys, and which was inscribed with the words 'My
      Last Wish,' he held it out to the King.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then your Majesty will perhaps grant her the burial she here demands?" he
      said&mdash;"It is a strange request!&mdash;but not difficult to gratify!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Taking the paper, the monarch touched it tenderly with his lips before
      opening it. In all the blind stupefaction of his own grief, he was struck
      by the fact that there was something strained and unnatural about Thord's
      appearance,&mdash;something wild and forced even in his expression of
      sorrow. He studied his face closely, but to no purpose;&mdash;there was no
      clue to the mystery packed within the harsh lines of those dark, fierce
      features,&mdash;he seemed no more and no less than the same brooding,
      leonine creature that had mercilessly planned the deaths of men in his own
      Revolutionary Committee. There was no touch of softness in his eyes,&mdash;no
      tears, even at the sight of Lotys smiling coldly in her flower-strewn
      shroud. And now, unfolding her last message, the King beheld it thus
      expressed:
    </p>
    <p>
      "To THOSE WHO SHALL FIND ME DEAD
    </p>
    <p>
      "I pray you of your gentle love and charity, not to bury my body in the
      earth, but in the sea. For I most earnestly desire no mark, or remembrance
      of the place where my sorrows, with my mortal remains, shall be rendered
      back to nature; and kinder than the worms in the mould are the wild waves
      of the ocean which I have ever loved! And there,&mdash;at least to my own
      thoughts,&mdash;if any spiritual part of me remains to watch my will
      performed,&mdash;shall I be best pleased and most grateful to be given my
      last rest. LOTYS."
    </p>
    <p>
      This document had been written and signed some years back, and had,
      therefore, nothing to do with any idea of immediate departure from the
      world, or premeditated suicide. And once again the King looked searchingly
      at Thord, as he returned him the paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Her will shall be performed!" he said&mdash;"And in a manner befitting
      her memory,&mdash;befitting the love borne to her by a People&mdash;and&mdash;a
      King!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He paused,&mdash;then went on softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "To you Sergius, my friend and comrade!&mdash;to you will be entrusted the
      task of committing this sweet casket of a sweeter soul to the mercy of the
      waves!&mdash;you, the guardian of her childhood, the defender of her
      womanhood, the protector of her life&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "O God! No more&mdash;no more!" cried Thord, suddenly falling on his knees
      by the couch of the dead&mdash;"No more&mdash;in mercy! I will do all&mdash;all!
      But leave me with her now!&mdash;leave me alone with her, this last little
      while!"
    </p>
    <p>
      And breaking into great sobs, he buried his head among the death-flowers
      in an utter abandonment of despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      Silently the King watched him for a little space. Then he turned his eyes
      towards the pale form of the woman he had loved, and who had taught him
      the noblest and most selfless part of love, sleeping her last sleep, with
      a fixed sweet smile upon her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We shall meet again, my Lotys!" he whispered&mdash;"On the other side of
      Death!"
    </p>
    <p>
      And so,&mdash;with the quiet air of one who knows a quick way out of
      difficulty, he departed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some five days later, a strange and solemn spectacle was witnessed by
      thousands of spectators from all the shores and quays of the sea-girt
      city. A ship set sail for the Land of the Infinite!&mdash;a silent
      passenger went forth on a voyage to the borders of the Unknown! Coffined
      in state,&mdash;with a purple velvet pall trailing its rich folds over the
      casket which enshrined her perished mortality,&mdash;and with flowers of
      every imaginable rareness, or wildness, scattered about it,&mdash;the body
      of Lotys was, with no religious or formal ceremony, placed on the deck of
      a sailing-brig, and sent out to the waves for burial. So Sergius Thord had
      willed it; so Sergius Thord had planned it. He had purchased the vessel
      for this one purpose, and with his own hands he had strewn the deck with
      blossoms, till it looked like a floating garden of fairyland. Garlands of
      roses trailed from the mast,&mdash;wreaths from every former member of the
      now extinct 'Revolutionary Committee' were heaped in profusion about the
      coffin which lay in the centre of the deck,&mdash;the sails were white as
      snow, and one of them bore, the name 'Lotys' upon it, in letters of gold.
      It was arranged that the brig should be towed from the harbour, and out to
      sea for about a couple of miles,&mdash;and when there, should be cut free
      and set loose to the wind and tide to meet its fate of certain wreckage in
      the tossing billows beyond. In strange contrast to this floating funeral
      were the brilliant flags and gay streamers which were already being put up
      along the streets and quays, as the first signs of the city's welcome to
      the Crown Prince and his bride, who were expected to arrive home somewhere
      within the next ten days. Eager crowds watched the unique ceremony,
      unknown save in old Viking days, of sending forth a dead voyager to sail
      the pitiless seas; and countless numbers of small boats attended the
      funeral vessel in a long flotilla,&mdash;escorting it out to that verge
      where the ocean opened widely to the wider horizon, and spread its high
      road of silver waves invitingly out to the approaching silent adventurer.
      Comments ran freely from lip to lip,&mdash;Sergius Thord had been seen,
      pale as death, laying flowers on the deck to the last,&mdash;the King,&mdash;yes!&mdash;the
      King himself had sent a wreath, as a token of remembrance, to the
      obsequies of the woman who had saved his life,&mdash;the purple velvet
      pall, with its glittering fringes of gold, had been the gift of the city
      of which Thord was the lately-elected Deputy,&mdash;Louis Valdor had sent
      that garland of violets,&mdash;the great wreath of roses which lay at the
      head of the coffin, was the offering of the famous little dancer, Pequita,
      who, it was said, now lay sick of a fever brought on by grief and fretting
      for the loss of her best friend,&mdash;and rich and poor alike had vied
      with one another in assisting the weird beauty of this exceptional and
      strange burial, in which no sexton was employed but the wild wind, which
      would in due time scoop a hollow in the sea, and whirl down into
      fathomless deeps all that remained of a loving woman, with the offerings
      of a People's love around her!
    </p>
    <p>
      From the Palace windows the Queen watched the weird pageant, with
      straining eyes, and a sense of relief at her heart. This unknown rival of
      hers,&mdash;this Lotys&mdash;was dead! Her body would soon be drifting out
      on the wild waste of waters, to be caught by the first storm and sunk in
      the depths of eternal silence. She was glad!&mdash;almost she could have
      sung for joy! The colour mantled on her fair cheeks,&mdash;she looked
      younger and more beautiful than ever. She had learned her long-neglected
      lesson,&mdash;the lesson of, 'how to love.' And to herself she humbly
      confessed the truth&mdash;that she loved no other than her husband! The
      King had now become the centre of her heart, as he had become the centre
      of his People's trust. And she watched the vessel bearing the corpse of
      Lotys, gliding, gliding over the waves&mdash;she tracked the circling
      concourse of boats that went with it&mdash;and waited, with quickened
      breath and eager eyes, till she saw a sudden pause in the procession&mdash;when,
      riding lightly on a shining wave, the funeral-ship seemed to stop for an
      instant&mdash;and then, with a bird-like dip forward, scurried out with
      full, bulging sails to the open sea! The crowding spectators began to
      break up and disperse&mdash;the flotilla of attendant boats turned back to
      shore&mdash;the dead woman who had held such magnetic influence over the
      King, was gone!&mdash;gone for ever into the watery caverns of endless
      death!
    </p>
    <p>
      It was with a light heart that the Queen at last rose from her watch at
      the window, and prepared to array herself for the return of her sovereign
      lord. Her eyes sparkled, her lips smiled; she looked the very incarnation
      of love and tenderness. The snow-peak had melted at last, and underneath
      the ice, love's late violets had begun to bloom! She glanced once more out
      at the sea, where the vanishing death-ship now seemed but a speck on the
      far horizon, and saw a bank of solemn purple clouds darkening the golden
      sunset line,&mdash;clouds that rose up thickly and swiftly, like magic
      mountains conjured into sudden existence by some witch in a fairy tale. A
      gust of wind shook the lattice&mdash;and moaned faintly through the chinks
      of the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There will be a storm to-night!" she said musingly, her eyes following
      the dispersing crowds, as they poured along the terrace from the shore, or
      climbed up from the quays to the higher streets of the town:&mdash;"There
      will be a storm!&mdash;and the woman who was called Lotys, will know
      nothing of it! The vessel she sails in will be crushed like a shell in the
      teeth of the blast, and her body will sink like a stone in the angry sea!
      So will she sleep&mdash;so does her brief power over the King come to an
      end!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Turning, she smiled at her lady-in-waiting, Teresa de Launay, who had also
      watched the sea funeral of Lotys with wondering and often tear-filled
      eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How the people must have loved her!" the girl murmured softly; "No poor
      person or child came to these strange obsequies without flowers!&mdash;many
      wept&mdash;and some swear there is no happiness at all for them now,
      without Lotys! She must have been a sweet, unselfish woman!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The Queen was silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Since she saved the life of our lord the King, I have often thought of
      her!" went on Teresa&mdash;"I have even hoped to see her! Dearest Madam,
      would you not have been glad to thank her once before she died?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The Queen's face hardened.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She only did her duty!" was the cold answer&mdash;"Every subject in the
      realm would be proud to have the chance of being the King's defender!"
    </p>
    <p>
      At that moment the door opened, and Sir Roger de Launay entered,&mdash;then
      drew back in some surprise and hesitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I crave your pardon, Madam!" he said, bowing low&mdash;"I thought the
      King was here!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Truly the King should be here by now,"&mdash;replied the Queen gently&mdash;"But
      he is doubtless detained among the people, who wait upon his footsteps, as
      though he were a demi-god!" She smiled happily. "He went out to see yonder
      strange funeral pageant&mdash;and left no word of the hour of his return."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Roger looked perplexed. The Queen noticed his expression of anxiety.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Stay but a moment, Sir Roger," she added&mdash;"Now I remember, he bade
      me at sunset, go to my own room and fetch a packet I would find from him
      there,&mdash;he may be waiting for me now!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She retired, the radiant smile still upon her face, and Sir Roger looked
      at his sister with concern for her tearful eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Weeping, Teresa?" he said&mdash;"What is the trouble?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing!" she answered quickly&mdash;"Only a presentiment of evil! That
      funeral-ship has made me sad!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Roger said nothing for the moment. He was too preoccupied with his own
      forebodings to give much heed to hers. He walked to the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There will be a storm to-night!" he said. "Look at those great clouds!
      They are big with thunder and with rain!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes!" murmured Teresa&mdash;"There will be a storm&mdash;Madam!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned with a cry to feel the Queen's grip on her shoulder&mdash;to
      see the Queen, white as marble, with blazing eyes, possessed by a very
      frenzy of grief and terror. A tragic picture of despairing Majesty, she
      confronted the startled De Launay with an open paper in her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where is the King?" she demanded, in accents that quivered with fear and
      passion. "From you, Sir Roger de Launay, must come the answer! To you, his
      friend and servant, I trusted his safety! And of you I ask again&mdash;Where
      is the King?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Stupefied and stunned, Sir Roger stared helplessly at this enraged
      splendour of womanhood, this embodied wrath of royalty.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Madam!" he stammered,&mdash;"I know nothing&mdash;save that the King has
      been sorely stricken by a great sorrow&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him with flashing eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sorrow for what?&mdash;for whom?"
    </p>
    <p>
      De Launay gazed at her amazedly;&mdash;why did she ask of what she knew so
      well?
    </p>
    <p>
      "Madam, to answer that is not within my province!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She was silent, breathing quickly. Great tears gathered on her lashes, but
      did not fall.
    </p>
    <p>
      "When saw you his Majesty last?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But three hours since, Madam! He bade me leave him alone, saying he would
      walk a while in the further grounds away from the sight of the sea. He had
      no mind, he said, to look upon the passing away of Lotys!"
    </p>
    <p>
      A strange grey pallor crept over the Queen's face. She stood proudly
      erect, yet tottered as though about to fall. Teresa de Launay ran to her
      in terror.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dearest Madam!" cried the trembling girl&mdash;"Be comforted! Be patient!
      The King will come!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He will never come!" said the Queen in a low choked voice;&mdash;"Never
      again&mdash;never, never again! I feel&mdash;I know&mdash;that I have lost
      him for ever! He has gone&mdash;but where?&mdash;O God!&mdash;where!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Madam!" said Sir Roger, shaken to the soul by the sight of her suppressed
      agony&mdash;"That paper in your hand&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "This paper," she said, with a convulsive effort at calmness, "makes me
      Regent till the return of my son, the Crown Prince&mdash;and&mdash;at the
      same time&mdash;bids me farewell! Farewell!&mdash;and why farewell? Oh,
      faithless servant!" and she advanced a step, fixing her burning eyes on
      the stricken De Launay&mdash;"I thought you loved me!"
    </p>
    <p>
      His face flushed&mdash;his lips quivered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "As God lives, Madam, I yield to no one in my love and service of you!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then find the King!" and she stretched out her arm with a gesture of
      authority&mdash;"Bring back to me my husband!&mdash;the one man of the
      world!&mdash;the one man I have learned to love! Follow the King!&mdash;whether
      on land or sea, whether alive or dead,&mdash;in heaven or hell, follow
      him! Your place is not with me&mdash;but by your master's side! If you
      know not whither he has fled, make it your business to learn!&mdash;and
      never let me see your face again till <i>his</i> face shines beside yours,
      like sunshine against darkness!&mdash;till his eyes, his smile make
      gladness where your presence without him is a mocking misery! Out of my
      sight! And nevermore return again, save in your duty and attendance on the
      King!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Madam,&mdash;Madam!" exclaimed Teresa&mdash;"Would you condemn my brother
      to a lasting banishment? What if the King were dead?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dead!" The word left the Queen's lips in a sharp sob of pain&mdash;"The
      King cannot die!&mdash;he is too strong&mdash;too bold and brave! He has
      met death ere now and conquered it! Dead? No&mdash;that is not possible&mdash;that
      could not be!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned again upon Sir Roger, standing mute and pale, a very statue of
      despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I give you a high mission!" she said&mdash;"Fulfil it!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He started from his unhappy reverie.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Be sure that I will do so!" he said&mdash;"I will&mdash;as your Majesty
      bids me&mdash;follow the King! And&mdash;till the King returns with me&mdash;I
      also say farewell!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Catching his sister in his arms, he kissed her with a murmured blessing&mdash;and
      profoundly saluting the woman for whose love's sake his very life was now
      demanded, he left the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Roger, Roger!" cried Teresa in an anguish, as the sound of his footsteps
      died away&mdash;"Come back! Come back!"
    </p>
    <p>
      And falling on her knees by the Queen's side, she burst into wild weeping.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If the King has gone for ever, my brother is gone too," she sobbed&mdash;"Oh,
      dearest Majesty, have you no heart?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "None!" said the Queen with a strained smile, while the slow, hot tears
      began to fall from her aching eyes&mdash;"None! What heart I had is gone!
      It follows the King!"

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXIV. &mdash; ABDICATION
    </h2>
    <p>
      A great storm was gathering. The heavy purple clouds which had arisen in
      the west at sunset, when all that was mortal of Lotys had been sent forth
      to a lonely burial in the sea, had gradually spread over the whole sky,
      darkening in hue as they moved, and rolling together in huge opaque
      masses, which presently began to close in and become denser as the night
      advanced. By and by a wild wind awoke, as it were, from the very cavities
      of ocean, and the waves began to hiss warnings all along the coast, and to
      rise higher and higher over each other's shoulders as the gale steadily
      increased. Réné Ronsard, sitting in his cottage, feeble and somewhat
      ailing, heard the beginnings of the tempest with long-accustomed ears. He
      was depressed in spirit, yet not altogether solitary, for he had with him
      a kindly companion in Professor von Glauben. The Professor had been one of
      the many who had attended the strange funeral-pageant of the afternoon,
      not only out of interest in, and regret for, the fate of the woman whose
      unique character he had admired, and whose difficult position he had
      pitied; but also because he had suffered from an unpleasant presentiment
      to which he could give no name. If he could have described his forebodings
      at all, he would have said they were more or less connected with the King,&mdash;but
      how or why, he would not have been able to explain, save that since the
      death of Lotys, his Sovereign master had no longer looked the same man.
      Stricken as with a blight, and grown suddenly old, his manner and
      appearance were as of one devoured by a secret despair,&mdash;a corroding
      disease,&mdash;of which the end could only be disastrous. Overcome by the
      pain and distress of being the constant witness of a sorrow which he felt
      to the heart, yet could not relieve, the Professor, on returning from the
      scene of Lotys's impressive funeral, had put ashore on The Islands,
      instead of going back to the mainland. He had sought permission from the
      King to remain with Ronsard for the night,&mdash;and the permission had
      been readily, almost eagerly granted. The King, indeed, had seemed glad to
      be relieved of the too anxious solicitude of his physician, who, he knew,
      was well aware of the concealed agony of mind which tortured and well-nigh
      maddened him,&mdash;and the Professor, keenly observant, was equally
      conscious that, under the immediate circumstances, his attendance might
      seem more of an intrusion than a duty.
    </p>
    <p>
      "De Launay was not far wrong when he prophesied danger for the King as the
      result of his beginning to think for himself;" he mused&mdash;"Yet it has
      come&mdash;this danger&mdash;in a different way to that in which we
      expected it! It is a bold move for the ruler of a country to make personal
      examination into the needs of his people,&mdash;but it is seldom that,
      while engaged in such a task, the ruler himself becomes ruled, by a
      stronger force than even his own temporal power!"
    </p>
    <p>
      And now, sitting with old Réné Ronsard, by a fire which had been kindled
      on this somewhat chilly night for his better comfort, he was, despite the
      impression of sadness and disaster which hung upon his mind as darkly as
      the clouds were hanging in heaven, doing his best to rouse both himself
      and his companion to greater cheerfulness. The wind, shaking the lattice,
      and now and then screaming dismally under the door, did not inspire him to
      gaiety, but his thoughts were principally for Ronsard, who was inclined to
      yield to an overpowering despondency.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This will never do, Ronsard!" he said after a pause, during which he had
      noticed a tear or two steal slowly down the old man's furrowed cheek;
      "What sort of a welcome will such a face as yours be to our Crown Princess
      Gloria? She will soon be here; think of it! And what a triumphant entry
      she will make, acclaimed by the whole nation!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall not be wanted in her life!" said Ronsard, slowly. "After all, I
      am nothing to her, and have no claim upon her. I found her, as a poor man
      may by chance find a rare jewel,&mdash;that the jewel is afterwards found
      worthy to be set in a king's crown, is not the business of that same poor
      man. He who merely hews a diamond out of the mine, is not the maker of the
      diamond!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Gloria loves you!" said the Professor; "And she will love you always!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Ronsard smiled faintly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My friend, I understand, and I accept the law of change!" he said. "To
      me, as to all, it must come! The old must die, and the young succeed them.
      As for me, I shall be glad to go&mdash;the sooner the better, I truly
      think, for then none will taunt my Gloria with the simple manner of her
      bringing up;&mdash;none will remember aught, save her exceeding beauty, or
      blame her that the sun and sea were her only known parents. And if we
      credit legend, hers is not the first birth of loveliness from the bosom of
      the waves!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Here the wind, tearing round the rafters, rattled and roared for a space
      like a demon threatening the whole construction of the house, and then
      went galloping away with a shriek among the pines down to the shore.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A wild night!" said the Professor, with a slight shiver. "Alas! poor
      Lotys!&mdash;poor 'Soul of an Ideal' as Sergius Thord called her,&mdash;her
      frail mortal tenement will soon be drawn down to the depths in such a
      storm as this!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I never saw her!" said Ronsard musingly; "Thord I have seen often. Lotys
      was to me a name merely,&mdash;but I knew it was a name to conjure with&mdash;a
      name beloved of the People. Gloria longed to see her,&mdash;she had heard
      of her often."
    </p>
    <p>
      "She was a psychological phenomenon," said the Professor slowly; "And I
      admit that her composition baffled me. No one have I ever seen at all like
      her. She was beautiful without any of the accepted essentials of beauty&mdash;and
      it is precisely such a woman as that who possesses the most dangerous
      fascination over men&mdash;not over boys&mdash;but over men. She had a
      loving, passionate, feminine heart, with a masculine brain,&mdash;the two
      together are bound to constitute what is called Genius. The only thing I
      cannot understand is the unexpected weakness she displayed in committing
      suicide. That I should never have thought of her. On the contrary, I
      should have imagined, knowing as much of her as I did, that the greater
      the sorrow, the greater the fight she would have made against it."
    </p>
    <p>
      A silence fell between them, filled by the thundering noise of the wind.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where is Thord?" asked Ronsard presently.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do not know. The last I saw of him was on board the vessel that bore
      her coffin;&mdash;he was laying flowers on the deck. He was not, I think,
      in any of the smaller boats that accompanied it; he must have returned
      with the crowd on shore. He has his duties as Deputy for the city now, we
      must remember!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Ronsard's eyes flashed with a glimmer of satire in the firelight.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If it had not been for Lotys, he would not be a Deputy, or anything else,&mdash;save
      perchance a Communist or an Anarchist!" he said; "he used to be one of the
      fiercest malcontents in all the country when I first came here. Many and
      many is the time I have heard him threaten to kill the King!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah!" said the Professor meaningly, the while he bent his eyes on the
      flickering fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again a silence fell. The wind roared and screamed around the building,
      and in the pauses of the gale, the minutes seemed weighted with a strange
      dread. Every tick of the clock sounded heavy and long, even to the
      equable-minded Professor. The storm outside was growing louder and even
      louder, and his thoughts, despite himself, turned to the
      ocean-wildernesses over which Prince Humphry's home-returning vessel must
      be now on its way&mdash;while that other solitary barque, unhelmed and
      unmanned, whose sail bore the name of 'Lotys' was also voyaging, but in a
      darker direction, down to death and oblivion, carrying with it, as he
      feared, all the love and heart of a King! Suddenly a loud knocking at the
      door startled them; and as Ronsard rose from his chair, amazed at the
      noise and Von Glauben did the same with more alacrity, a man with wind
      blown hair and excited gestures burst into the little room.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ronsard!" he cried; "The King&mdash;the King!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He paused, gasping for breath. Ronsard looked at him wonderingly. His
      clothes were saturated with sea-water,&mdash;his face was pale&mdash;and
      his eyes expressed some fear that his tongue seemed incapable of uttering.
      He was one of the coral-fishers of the coast, and Ronsard knew him well.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What ails you, man?" he asked; "What say you of the King?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Holding the door of the cottage open with some difficulty, the
      coral-fisher pointed to the sky overhead. It was flecked with great masses
      of white cloud, through which the moon appeared to roll rapidly like a
      ball of yellow fire. The wind howled furiously, and the pines in the near
      distance could be seen bending to and fro like reeds in its breath, while
      the roar of the sea beyond the rocks was fierce and deafening.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is all storm!" cried the man, excitedly; "The billows are running
      mountains high!&mdash;there is no chance for him!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No chance for whom?" demanded Von Glauben, impatiently; "What would you
      tell us? Speak plainly!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was the King!" said the coral-fisher again, trying to express himself
      more collectedly&mdash;"I saw his face lit up by the after-glow of the sky&mdash;white&mdash;white
      as the foam on the wave! Listen! When the body of the woman Lotys was
      borne away on that vessel, a man came to me out of the thickest of the
      crowd (I was on one of the furthest quays)&mdash;and offered me a purse of
      gold to take him out to sea&mdash;and to steer him in such a way that we
      should meet the funeral barque just as she was cut adrift and sent forth
      to be wrecked in the ocean. I did not know him then. He kept his face
      hidden,&mdash;he spoke low, and he was evidently in trouble. I thought he
      was a lover of the dead woman, and sought perhaps to comfort himself by
      looking at her coffin for the last time. So I consented to do what he
      asked. I had my sailing skiff, and we went at once. The wind was strong;
      we sailed swiftly&mdash;and at the appointed place&mdash;" He paused to
      take breath. Ronsard seized him by the arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quick! Go on&mdash;what next?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "At the appointed place when the vessel stopped,&mdash;when her ropes were
      cut and she afterwards sprang out to sea, I, by his orders, ran my skiff
      close beside her as she came,&mdash;and before I knew how it happened, my
      passenger sprang aboard her&mdash;Ay!&mdash;with a spring as light and
      sure as the flight of a bird! 'Farewell!' he said, and flung me the
      promised gold; 'May all be prosperous with you and yours!' And then the
      wind swooped down and bore the ship a mile or more ere I could follow it;
      but the strong light in the west fell full upon the man's face&mdash;and I
      saw&mdash;I knew it was the King!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Gott in Himmel! May you for ever be confounded and mistaken!" exclaimed
      Von Glauben,&mdash;"I left the King in his own grounds but an hour before
      I myself started to witness this accursed sea-funeral!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I say it was the King!" repeated the man emphatically. "I would swear it
      was the King! And the vessel going out to meet the storm tonight, holds
      the living, as well as the dead!"
    </p>
    <p>
      With a sudden movement, as active as it was decided, old Ronsard went to a
      corner in the room and drew out a thick coil of rope with an iron hook at
      the end, and slinging it round his waist with the alert quickness of
      youth, made for the open door.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where is your skiff?" he demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ashore down yonder;" answered the coral-fisher; "But you&mdash;what are
      you going to do? You cannot sail her in such a night as this!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will adventure!" said Ronsard. "If, as you say, it was the King, I will
      save him if he can be saved! Once a King's life was nothing to me; now it
      is something! The tide veers round these Islands, and the vessel on which
      they have placed the body of Lotys, can scarcely drift away from the
      circle till morning, unless the waves are too strong for it&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "They are too strong!" cried the coral-fisher; "Ronsard, believe me! There
      is no rain to soften or abate the wind&mdash;and the sea grows greater
      with every breath of the rising gale!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I care nothing!" replied Ronsard; "Let be! If you are afraid, I will go
      alone!"
    </p>
    <p>
      At these words, the Professor suddenly awoke to the situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What would you attempt, Ronsard?" he exclaimed; "You can do nothing! You
      are weak and ailing!&mdash;there is no force in you to combat with the
      elements on such a night as this&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "There <i>is</i> force!" said Ronsard; "The force of my thirst for
      atonement! Let me be, for God's sake! Let me do something useful in my
      life!&mdash;let me try to save the King! If I die, so much the better."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then I will go with you!" said Von Glauben, desperately.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ronsard shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You? No, my friend! You will not! You will remain to welcome Gloria&mdash;to
      tell her that I loved her to the last!&mdash;that I did my best!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He seemed to have grown young in an instant,&mdash;his eyes flashed with
      alertness and vigour, and instead of an old decaying man, full of cares
      and despondencies, he seemed like a bold adventurer, before whom a new
      land of promise opens. Von Glauben looked at him, and in a moment made up
      his mind. He turned to the coral-fisher.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What think you truly of the night, my friend? Is it for life or death we
      go?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Death! Certain death!" answered the man; "It is madness to set sail in
      such a storm as this!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are married, no doubt? And little ones eat your earnings? Ach so!
      Then you shall not be asked to go with us. Ronsard, I am ready! I can pull
      an oar and manage a sail, and I am not afraid of death by drowning! For
      Gloria's sake, let me go with you!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "For Gloria's sake, stay here!" cried Ronsard; and with an abrupt movement
      he escaped Von Glauben's hold, and ran with all the speed of a boy out of
      the cottage into the garden beyond.
    </p>
    <p>
      Von Glauben rushed after him, but found himself in the thicket of pines,
      trapped and hemmed in by the darkness of their stems and branches. The
      wind was so fierce and strong, that he could scarcely keep his feet,&mdash;every
      now and again the moon flew out of a great cloud-pinnacle and glared on
      the scene, but not with sufficient clearness to show him his way. Yet he
      knew the place well&mdash;often had he and Gloria trodden that path down
      to the sea, and yet to-night it seemed all unfamiliar. How the sea roared!
      Like a thousand lions clamouring for prey! Against the rocks the rising
      billows hissed and screamed, rattling backward among stones and shells
      with the grinding noise of artillery wagons being hastily dragged off a
      lost field of battle.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ronsard!" he called as loudly as he could, and again "Ronsard!" but his
      voice, big and stentorian though it was, made but the feeblest wail in the
      loud shriek of the wind. Yet he stumbled on and on, and by slow and
      difficult degrees found his way down to the foot of the high rocks which
      formed a pinnacled wall between him and the sea,&mdash;the rocks he had so
      often climbed with Gloria, and of which she had sung in such matchless
      tones of triumph and tenderness.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    Here, by the sea.
    My King crown'd me!
  Wild ocean sang for my Coronation,
  With the jubilant voice of a mighty nation!
</pre>
    <p>
      The memory of this song came back to his ears in a ringing echo, amid the
      howling of the boisterous wind, which now blew harder and harder,
      scattering masses of blown froth from the waves in his face, with flying
      sand and light shells, and torn-up weed. Scarcely able to stand against
      it, he paused to get his breath, realising that it would be worse than
      useless to climb the rocks in the teeth of such a gale, or try to reach
      the old accustomed winding way down to the shore. He endeavoured to
      collect his scattered wits;&mdash;if the ceaseless onslaught of the storm
      would only have allowed him to think coherently, he fancied he might have
      found another and easier path to lead him in the direction whither
      Ronsard, in his mad, but heroic impulse, had gone. But the gale was so
      terrific, and the booming of the great waves on the other side of the
      rocky barrier so awful, that it seemed as if the water must be rolling in
      like a solid wall, bent on breaking down the coast, and grinding it to
      powder. His heart ached heavily;&mdash;tears rose to his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What a grain of dust I am in this world of storm!" he ejaculated; "Here I
      stand,&mdash;a strong man, utterly useless! Powerless to save the life I
      would die to serve! But maybe the story is not true!&mdash;the man can
      easily have been mistaken! Surely the King would not give up all for the
      sake of one woman's love!"
    </p>
    <p>
      But though he said this to himself, he knew that such things have been;
      indeed, that they are common enough throughout all history. He had not
      studied humanity to so little purpose as not to be aware that there are
      certain phases of the passion of love which make havoc of a man's wisest
      and best intentions; and that even as Marc Antony lost all for Cleopatra's
      smile, and Harry the Eighth upset a Church for a woman's whim, so in
      modern days the same old story repeats itself; and no matter how great and
      famous the position of a king or an emperor, he may yet court and obtain
      his own ruin and disaster, ay, lose his very Throne for love;&mdash;deeming
      it well lost!
    </p>
    <p>
      Restless, miserable and troubled by the confusion of his thoughts, which
      seemed to run wild with the wild wind and the thundering sea, the unhappy
      Professor retraced his steps to the cottage, hoping against hope that
      Ronsard, physically unable to cope with the storm, would have returned,
      baffled in his reckless attempt to put forth a boat to sea. But the little
      home was silent and deserted. There was the old man's empty chair;&mdash;the
      clock against the wall ticked the minutes away with a comfortable
      persistence which was aggravating to the nerves; the fire was still
      bright. Before entering, Von Glauben looked up and down everywhere
      outside, but there was no sign of any living creature.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing remained for him to do but to resign himself passively to
      whatsoever calamity the Omnipotent Forces above him chose to inflict,&mdash;and
      utterly weary, baffled and helpless, he sank into Ronsard's vacant chair,
      unconscious that tears were rolling down his face from the excess of his
      anxiety and exhaustion. The shrieking of the wind, the occasional glare of
      the moonlight through the rattling lattice windows, and the apparent
      rocking of the very rafters above him thrilled him into new and ever
      recurring sensations of fear&mdash;yet he was no coward, and had often
      prided himself on having 'nerves of steel and sinews of iron.' Presently,
      he began to see quaint faces and figures in the glowing embers of the
      fire; old scraps of song and legend haunted him; fragments of Heine, mixed
      up with long-winded philosophical phrases of Schopenhauer, began to make
      absurd contradictions and glaring contrasts in his mind, while he listened
      to the awful noises of the storm; and the steady ticking of the clock on
      the wall worried him to such an almost childish degree, that had he not
      thought how often he had seen Gloria winding up that clock and setting it
      to the right hour, he could almost have torn it down and broken it to
      pieces. By and by, however, tired Nature had her way, and utterly heavy
      and worn out in mind and body, and weary of the disturbed and incoherent
      thoughts in his brain, he lay back and closed his eyes. He would rest a
      little while, he said to himself, and 'wait.' And so he gradually fell
      asleep, and in his sleep wrote, so he imagined, a whole eloquent chapter
      of his 'Political History of Hunger' in which he described Sergius Thord
      as a despot, who, after proving false to the cause of the People, and
      grinding them down by unlimited taxation such as no Government had ever
      before inflicted, seized the rightful king of the country, and sent him
      away to be drowned in company with a woman of the People, whose body was
      fastened to his by ropes and iron chains, in the fashion of 'Les Noyades'
      of Nantes. And he thought that the King rejoiced in his doom, and said
      strange words like those of the poet who sang of a similar story:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  "For never a man like me
  Shall die like me till the whole world dies,
  I shall drown with her, laughing for love, and she
  Mix with me, touching me, lips and eyes!"
</pre>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, Ronsard, true to the instinct within him, had fulfilled his
      intention and had put out to sea. The fisherman who had brought the
      tidings which had moved him to this desperate act, was too much of a hero
      in himself to let the old man venture forth alone,&mdash;and so, following
      him down to the shore, had, despite all commands and entreaties to the
      contrary, insisted on going with him. The sailing skiff he owned was a
      strong boat, stoutly built,&mdash;and at first it seemed as if their
      efforts to ride the mountainous billows would be crowned with success. Old
      Rene had a true genius for the management of a sail; his watchfulness
      never flagged:&mdash;his strenuous exertions would have done credit to a
      man less than half his age. With delicate precision he guided the ropes,
      as a jockey might have guided the reins of a racehorse, and the vessel
      rose and fell lightly over the great waves, with such ease and rapidity,
      that the man who accompanied him and took the helm, an experienced sailor
      himself, began to feel confident that after all the voyage might not be
      altogether futile.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The sea may be calmer further out from land!" he shouted to Rene, who
      nodded a quiet aquiescence, while he kept his eyes earnestly fixed on the
      horizon, which the occasional brightness of the moon showed up like a line
      of fretted silver. Everywhere he scanned the waves for a glimpse of the
      fatal vessel bearing Death&mdash;and perhaps Life&mdash;on board; but over
      the whole expanse of the undulating hills and valleys of wild water, there
      was no speck of a boat to be seen save their own. They swept on and on,
      the wind aiding them with savage violence&mdash;when suddenly the man at
      the helm shouted excitedly:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ronsard! See yonder! There she sails!"
    </p>
    <p>
      With an exclamation of joy, Ronsard sprang up, and looking, saw within
      what seemed an apparently short distance, the drifting funeral-barque he
      sought. So far she seemed intact; her sails were bellying out full to the
      wind, and she was rising and plunging bravely over the great breakers,
      which rolled on in interminable array, one over the other,&mdash;with
      rugged foam-crests that sprang like fountains to the sky. A five or ten
      minutes' run with the wind would surely bring them alongside,&mdash;and
      Ronsard turned with an eager will to his work once more. Over the heads of
      the monstrous waves, rising with their hills, sinking in their valleys, he
      guided the few yielding planks that were between him and destruction,
      trimming the straining sail to the ferocious wind, and ever keeping his
      eyes fixed on the vessel which was the object of his search,&mdash;the
      sole aim and end of his reckless voyage, and which seemed now to recede,
      and then to almost disappear, the more earnestly he strove to reach it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "To save the King!" he muttered&mdash;"To save&mdash;not to kill! For
      Gloria's sake!&mdash;to save the King!"
    </p>
    <p>
      A capricious gust from the beating wings of the storm swooped down upon
      him sideways, as he twisted the ropes and tugged at them in a herculean
      effort to balance the plunging boat and keep her upright,&mdash;and in the
      loud serpent-like hiss of the waves around him, he did not hear his
      companion's wild warning cry&mdash;a cry of despair and farewell in one! A
      toppling dark-green mass of water, moving on shoreward, lifted itself
      quite suddenly, as it were, to its full height, as though to stare at the
      puny human creatures who thus had dared to oppose the fury of the
      elements, and then, leaping forward like a devouring monster, broke over
      their frail skiff, sweeping the sail off like a strip of ribbon, snapping
      the mast and rolling over and over them with a thousand heads of foam
      that, spouting upwards, again fell into dark cavernous deeps, covering and
      dragging down everything on the surface with a tumult and roar! It passed
      on thundering,&mdash;but left a blank behind it. Skiff and men had
      vanished,&mdash;and not a trace of the wreck floated on the angry waves!
    </p>
    <p>
      For one blinding second, Ronsard, buffeting the wild waves, saw the face
      of Gloria,&mdash;that best-beloved fair face,&mdash;angelic, pitying,
      loving to the last,&mdash;shine on him like a star in the darkness!&mdash;the
      next he was whelmed into the silence of the million dead worlds beneath
      the sea! So at last he paid his life's full debt. So, at last his
      atonement was fulfilled. If it was true,&mdash;as he had in an unguarded
      moment confessed,&mdash;that he had once killed a King, then the
      resistless Law of Compensation had worked its way with him,&mdash;inasmuch
      as he had been forced to render up what he cherished most,&mdash;the love
      of Gloria,&mdash;to the son of a King, and had ended his days in an effort
      to save the life of a King! For the rest, whatever the real nature of his
      long-hidden secret,&mdash;whatever the extent of the torture he had
      suffered in his conscience, his earthly punishment was over; and the story
      of his past crime would never be known to the living world of men. One
      sinner,&mdash;one sufferer among many millions, he was but a floating
      straw on the vast whirlpools of Time,&mdash;and whether he prayed for
      pardon and obtained it, whether he had worked out his own salvation or had
      lost it, may not be known of him, or of any of us, till God makes up the
      sum of life, in which perchance none of even the smallest numerals shall
      be found missing!
    </p>
    <p>
      Wilder grew the night, and more tempestuous the sea, while the sky became
      a mountainous landscape of black and white clouds fitfully illumined by
      the moon, which appeared to run over their fleecy pinnacles and sable
      plains like some scared white creature pursued by invisible foes: The
      vessel on which the corpse of Lotys lay, palled in purple, and decked with
      flowers, flew over the waves, to all seeming with the same hunted rapidity
      as the moon rushed through the heavens,&mdash;and so far, though her masts
      bent reed-like in the wind, and her sails strained at their cordage, she
      had come to no harm. Tossed about as she was, rudderless and solitary,
      there was something almost miraculous in the way she had weathered a storm
      in which many a well-guided ship must inevitably have gone down. The
      purple pall with its heavy fringe of gold, that shrouded the coffin she
      carried, was drenched through and through by the sea, and the flowers on
      the deck were beaten and drowned in the salt spray that dashed over them.
    </p>
    <p>
      But amid all the ruined blossoms of earth, by the side of the dead, and
      full-fronted to the tempest, stood one living man, for whom life had no
      charm, and death no terror&mdash;the King! What had been reported of him
      was true&mdash;he had resigned his Throne and left his kingdom for the
      sake of adventuring forth on this great voyage of Discovery,&mdash;this
      swift and stormy sail with Lotys to the Land of the Unknown! Whether it
      was a madness, or a sick dream that fevered his blood, he knew not&mdash;but
      once the woman he loved was dead, every hope, every ambition in him died
      too&mdash;and he felt himself to be a mere corpse of clay, unwillingly
      dragged about by a passionate soul that longed, and strove, and fought in
      its shell for larger freedom. All his life, so to speak, save for the last
      few months, he had been a prisoner;&mdash;he had never, as he had himself
      declared, known the sweetness of liberty;&mdash;but for the sake of Lotys,&mdash;had
      she lived,&mdash;he would have been content to still wear the chains of
      monarchy, and would have endeavoured to accomplish such good as he might,
      and make such reforms as could possibly benefit his country. But, after
      all, it is only a 'possibility 'that any reforms will avail to satisfy any
      people long; and he was philosopher and student enough to know that
      whatsoever good one may endeavour to do for the wider happiness and
      satisfaction of the multitude, they are as likely as not to turn and cry
      out&mdash;"Thy good is our evil! Thy love to us is but thine own serving!"&mdash;and
      so turn and rend their best benefactors. With the loss of Lotys, he lost
      the one mainspring of faith and enthusiasm which would have helped him to
      match himself against his destiny and do battle with it. A great weariness
      seized upon him,&mdash;a longing for some wider scope of action than such
      futile work as that of governing, or attempting to govern, a handful of
      units whose momentary Order was bound, in a certain period of time to
      lapse into Disorder&mdash;then into Order again, and so on till the end of
      all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hence his resolve to sail the seas with Lotys to that 'other side of
      Death' of which she had spoken,&mdash;that 'other side' which an inward
      instinct told him was not Death, but Life! He could not of himself analyse
      the emotions which moved him. He could not take the measure of his grief;
      it was too wide and too painful. He might have said with Heine: "Go,
      prepare me a bier of strong wood, longer than the bridge at Mayence, and
      bring twelve giants stronger than the vigorous St. Christopher of Cologne
      Cathedral on the Rhine;&mdash;they will carry the coffin and fling it in
      the sea,&mdash;so large a coffin needs a large grave! Would you know why
      the bier must be so long and large? With myself, I lay there at the same
      time all my love and my sorrow!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Sovereignty,&mdash;a throne,&mdash;a kingdom,&mdash;even an Empire&mdash;seemed
      poor without love to grace them. Had he never known the pure ideal
      passion, he would still have missed it;&mdash;but having known it&mdash;having
      felt its power environing him day and night with a holy and spiritual
      tenderness, he could not but follow it when it was withdrawn&mdash;follow
      it, ay, even into the realms of blackest night! Like the 'Pilgrim of
      Love,' delineated by one of the greatest painters in the world, he recked
      nothing of the darkness closing in,&mdash;of the pain and bewilderment of
      the road, which could only lead to interminable, inexplicable mystery;&mdash;he
      felt the hand of the great Angel upon him&mdash;the Angel of Love whom
      alone he cared to serve,&mdash;and if Love's way led to Death, why then
      Death would be surely as sweet as Love! A great and almost divine calm had
      taken possession of him from the moment he had fulfilled his intention of
      boarding the ship which carried away from him all that was mortal of the
      woman he had secretly idolised. The wild turbulence of Nature around him
      had only intensified his perfect content. He had pleased himself by taking
      care of the sleeping Lotys&mdash;such tender care! He had tried to shield
      her coffin from the onslaughts of the fierce waves; he had protected many
      of the funeral flowers from destruction, and had lifted the gold fringe of
      the purple pall many and many a time out of the drenching spray cast over
      it. There was a strange delight in doing this. Lotys knew! That was his
      chief reflection. And 'on the other side of Death,' as she had said, they
      would meet&mdash;and to that 'other side' they were sailing together with
      all the speed Heaven's own forces could give to their journey. Oh, that
      'other side'! What brightness, what peace, what glory, what mutual
      comprehension, what deep and perfect and undisturbed love would be found
      there! He smiled as he watched the swollen and angry sea,&mdash;the rising
      billows shouldering each other and bearing each other down;&mdash;how much
      grander, how much more spiritual and near to God, he thought, was this
      conflict of the elements, than the petty wars of men!&mdash;their desires
      of conquest, their greed of gold, their thirst for temporal power!
    </p>
    <p>
      "My Lotys!" he said aloud; "You knew the world! You knew the littleness of
      worldly ambition! You knew that there is only one thing worth living and
      dying for, and that is Love! Your heart was all love, my Lotys! Deprived
      of love for yourself, you gave all you had to those who needed it, and
      when you found my love for you might do me harm in the People's honour,
      you sacrificed your life! Alas, my Lotys! If you could but have realised
      that through you, and the love of you, I a King, who had long missed my
      vocation, could alone be truly worthy of sovereignty!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He laid his hand on her coffin with a tender touch, as though to soothe
      its quiet occupant.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My beloved!" he said, "We shall meet very soon!&mdash;very soon now! 'on
      the other side of death'&mdash;and God will understand,&mdash;and be
      pitiful!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The storm now seemed to be at its height. The monstrous waves, as they
      arose to combat the frail vessel in her swift career, made a bellowing
      clamour, and once or twice the ship reeled and staggered, as though about
      to lurch forward and go under. But the King felt no fear,&mdash;no horror
      of his approaching fate. He watched the wild scene with interest, even
      with appreciation,&mdash;as an artist or painter might watch the changes
      in a landscape which he purposes immortalising. His past life appeared to
      him like a picture in a magic crystal,&mdash;blurred and uncertain,&mdash;a
      mist of shapes without decided meaning or colour. He thought of the
      beautiful cold Queen, his wife,&mdash;and wondered whether she would weep
      for his loss.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not she!"&mdash;and he almost smiled at the idea&mdash;"Perhaps there
      will be a ballad written about it&mdash;and she will listen, unchanged,
      unmoved&mdash;as she listened that night when her minstrels sang:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  'We shall drift along till we both grow old
  Looking back on the days that have passed us by,
  When "what might have been," can no longer be,
  When I lost you and you lost me!'
</pre>
    <p>
      That was a quaint song&mdash;and a true one! She will not weep!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he went over in memory the various scenes of his life&mdash;brilliant,
      useless, and without results&mdash;when he was Heir-Apparent;&mdash;he
      thought of his two young sons, Rupert and Cyprian, who were as indifferent
      to him as young foals to their sire,&mdash;and anon, his mind turned more
      tenderly to his eldest-born, Prince Humphry, and the fair girl he had so
      boldly wedded,&mdash;the happy twain, who, returning homeward, would find
      the Throne ready for their occupancy, and a whole nation waiting to
      welcome them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "God bless them both!" he said aloud, lifting his calm eyes to the wild
      heavens&mdash;"They have the one shield and buckler against all misfortune&mdash;Love!
      And I thank God that I have not the sin upon my conscience of having
      broken that shield away from them; or of having forced their young lives
      asunder! Wiser than I, they took their own way and kept it!&mdash;may they
      so keep it always!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Then a thought of 'the People' came to him&mdash;the People who had
      latterly taken to idolising him, and making of him a hero greater than any
      monarch whose deeds have ever been glorified since history began.
    </p>
    <p>
      "They will forget!" he said&mdash;"Nowadays Nations have short memories!
      Battles and conquests, defeats and victories pass over the national mind
      as rapidly and changefully as the clouds are flying over the sky to-night!&mdash;the
      People remember neither their disgraces nor their triumphs in the life of
      individual Self which absorbs each little unit. Their idolatry of one
      monarch quickly changes to their idolatry of another! I shall perhaps be
      regretted for six months as my father was&mdash;and then&mdash;consigned
      with my ancestors to oblivion! Nothing so beautiful or so gladdening to
      the heart of a Monarch as the love of his People!&mdash;but&mdash;at the
      same time&mdash;nothing so changeable or uncertain as such love!&mdash;nothing
      so purely temporal! And nothing so desperately sad, so irremediably tragic
      as the death of kings!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Rapidly he reviewed the situation&mdash;the new Ministry, the new
      Government members were elected&mdash;and business would begin again
      immediately after the Crown Prince's return. All the reforms he had been
      prepared to carry out, would be effected,&mdash;and then would come the
      new King's Coronation. What a dazzling picture of resplendent beauty would
      be seen in Gloria, robed and crowned! His heart beat rapidly at the mere
      contemplation of it. For himself he had no thought&mdash;save to realise
      that the strange manner of his disappearance from his kingdom would
      probably only awaken a sense of resentment in 'society,' and a vague
      superstition among the masses, who would for a long time cling to the
      belief that he was not dead, but that like King Arthur he had only gone to
      the 'island valley of Avillion' to "heal him of his grievous wound,"&mdash;from
      which deep vale of rest he would return, rejoicing in his strength again.
      Sergius Thord would know the truth&mdash;for to Sergius Thord he had
      written the truth. And the letter would reach him this very night&mdash;this
      night of his last earthly voyage.
    </p>
    <p>
      "When his great sorrow has abated," he said, "he too will forget! He has
      all his work to do&mdash;all his career to make&mdash;and he will make it
      well and nobly! Even for his sake, and for his future, it is well that I
      am gone&mdash;for if he ever came to know,&mdash;if he were to guess even
      remotely, through Zouche's ravings, or some other means, the reason why
      Lotys killed herself, he would hate me,&mdash;and with justice! He loves
      the People&mdash;he will serve their Cause better than I!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The moon stared whitely out of a cloud just then,&mdash;and to his
      amazement and awe, he suddenly perceived the black shadow of a man lifting
      itself slowly, slowly from the hold of the ship, like a massive bulk, or
      ghost in the gloom. Unable to imagine what this might be, or how any other
      human creature save himself would venture to sail with the dead on a
      voyage whose end could be but destruction, he advanced a step towards that
      looming shape, and started back with a cry, as he recognised the very man
      he had been thinking of&mdash;Sergius Thord!
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sergius!" he cried aghast.
    </p>
    <p>
      "King!" and Thord looked scarcely human in the pale fleeting moonbeams, as
      he too stared in half-maddened wonder at the face and form of a companion
      on this dread journey such as he had never expected to see. "What do you
      here in the midst of the sea and the storm? You should be at home!&mdash;playing
      the fool in your Palace!&mdash;giving audiences on your throne!&mdash;you&mdash;you
      have no right to die with Lotys, whom I loved!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "With Lotys whom you loved!" echoed the King; "You loved her&mdash;true!
      But I loved her more!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You lie!" said Thord, furiously; "No man&mdash;no King,&mdash;no Emperor
      of all the world, could ever have loved Lotys as I loved her! These great
      waves waiting to devour us&mdash;dead and living together&mdash;are not
      more insatiate in their passion for us than I in my passion for Lotys! I
      loved her!&mdash;and when she scorned me&mdash;when she rejected me,&mdash;when
      she openly confessed that she loved you&mdash;the King&mdash;what remained
      for her but death! Death, rather than dishonour at your Royal hands, Sir!"
      And he laughed fiercely&mdash;a laugh with the ring of madness in it. "I
      rescued her as a child from starvation and misery&mdash;and so I may say I
      gave her her life. What I gave, I took again&mdash;I had the right to take
      it! I would not see her shamed by you&mdash;dishonoured by you&mdash;branded
      by you!&mdash;I did the only thing left to me to save her from you&mdash;I
      killed her!"
    </p>
    <p>
      With a loud cry the King, no longer so much king as man, with every
      passion roused, sprang at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You killed her? Oh, treacherous devil! They said she killed herself!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hands off!" cried Thord, suddenly pointing a pistol at him; "I will shoot
      you as readily as I shot her if you touch me! She killed herself you
      think? Oh, yes&mdash;in a strange way! Her last words were: 'Say I did it
      myself! Tell the King I did it myself!' A lie! All women are fond of
      lying. But her lie was to protect Me! Her last thought was for my defence,&mdash;not
      yours! Her last wish was to save Me, not you!&mdash;King though you are&mdash;lover
      though you craved to be! I say I murdered her! This is my Day of Fate,&mdash;the
      day on which it seems that Heaven itself has drawn lots with me to kill a
      King! Why did I ever relax my hate of you? It was inborn in me&mdash;a
      part of me,&mdash;my very life, the utmost portion of my work! I called
      you friend;&mdash;I curse myself that I ever did so!&mdash;for from the
      first you were my enemy&mdash;my rival in the love of Lotys! What did I
      care for the People? What did you? We were both at one in the love of the
      same woman! And now I am here to die with her alone! Alone, I say&mdash;do
      you hear me? I will be alone with her to the last&mdash;you shall not
      share with us in our sea burial! I will die beside her,&mdash;all, all
      alone!&mdash;and drift out with her to the darkness of the grave, to meet
      my fate with her&mdash;always with her,&mdash;whether her spirit lead me
      to Hell or to Heaven!"
    </p>
    <p>
      His insensate frenzy was so desperate, so terrible, that by its very force
      the strange mental composure of the King became intensified. Quietly
      folding his arms, he took his stand by the coffin of the dead in silence.
      The dashing spray that leaped at the masts of the vessel,&mdash;the wind
      that scooped up the billows into higher and higher pinnacles of emerald
      green, might have been soundless and powerless, for all he seemed to hear
      or to heed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why are you with us?" cried Thord again&mdash;"How came you on this ship,
      where I thought I had hidden myself alone with her, voyaging to Death?
      Could you not have left her to me?&mdash;you who have a throne and kingdom&mdash;I,
      to whom she was all my life!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I came&mdash;as you have come"&mdash;answered the King&mdash;"to die with
      her&mdash;or rather not to die, but to find Life with her! She loved me!"
    </p>
    <p>
      With a savage curse, Thord raised the pistol he held. The King looked him
      full in the eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Take good aim, Sergius!" he said tranquilly&mdash;"For here between us
      lies Lotys&mdash;the silent witness of your deed! Go hence, if you must,
      with two murders on your soul! There is no escape from death for either
      you or me, take it how we may;&mdash;and I care not at all how I meet it,
      whether at your hands or in the waves of the sea! Give me the same death
      you gave to Lotys! I ask no better end! For so at least shall we meet more
      quickly!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Half choked with his fury, Thord looked at him with fixed and glassy eyes.
      He was jealous of death!&mdash;jealous that death should of itself seem to
      reunite Lotys and the man she had loved more closely together! Standing
      erect by the purple pall that covered the one woman of the world to them
      both, the King looked 'every inch a king,'&mdash;the incarnation of pride,
      love, resolve and courage. With a sudden wild-beast cry, Thord sprang at
      him and caught his arm with one hand, the pistol grasped in the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Too near!" he gasped; "You shall not stand too near her!&mdash;you shall
      not die so close to her!&mdash;you shall not have the barest chance of
      resting where she sleeps!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He fell back, as the King's calm eyes regarded him steadfastly,
      imperiously, almost commandingly, without a trace of fear. He trembled.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do not look so!" he muttered; "I cannot kill you!&mdash;not if you look
      so!&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      Raising the pistol, he took apparent aim. The King stood unmoved, only
      murmuring softly to himself: 'On the other side of Death, my Lotys!&mdash;On
      the other side!'
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a loud report, a crash in his ears&mdash;then&mdash;as he
      staggered back, stunned by the shock, he saw that he was untouched,
      unhurt. Thord had turned the pistol against his own breast, and reeling
      backward, with a last supreme effort, dragged his sinking body to the
      vessel's edge.
    </p>
    <p>
      "God save your Majesty!" he cried wildly; "Tell Lotys I did it myself! God
      knows that is true!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The wild waves, clambering up over the deck rushed at him, and an enormous
      foam-crested billow, higher and stronger than all the rest, beat at the
      mast of the vessel and snapped it in twain. It came down, dragging the
      sail with it in a tangle of cordage, and with that sail the name of
      'Lotys' inscribed upon it was whirled furiously out to sea. The body of
      the vessel, now netted in a mass of ropes and rigging, began to roll
      helplessly in the trough of the waves, and the corpse of Thord, sinking
      under it as it plunged, was swept away like a leaf in the storm! Gone, his
      wild heart and wilder brain!&mdash;gone his restless ambition,&mdash;gone
      his unsatisfied love&mdash;his fierce passions, his glimmerings of a noble
      nature which if trained and guided, might have worked to noblest ends.
      Like many would-be leaders of men, he could not lead himself&mdash;like
      many who seek to control law, and revolutionise the world, he had been
      unable to master his own desperate soul. He was not the first,&mdash;he
      will not be the last,&mdash;who for purely personal ends has sought to
      'serve the People'! The disinterested, the impersonal and unselfish Leader
      has yet to come,&mdash;and if he ever does come, it is more than probable
      that those for whom he gives his life, will be the first to crucify his
      soul, and cry 'Thou hast a devil!'
    </p>
    <p>
      Death was now sole commander of the ocean that night! And the King of a
      mere little earth-country, realised to the full that he stood irrevocably
      face to face with the last great Enemy of Empires. Yet never had he looked
      more truly imperial,&mdash;never more superbly the incarnation of life! A
      mighty exultation began to stir within him&mdash;a consciousness that he,
      despite all the terrors of the grave, would still come forth the
      conqueror! The waves, leaping at him, were friends, not foes,&mdash;the
      moon shedding ghostly glamours on the watery wilderness, smiled as though
      she knew that he would soon be a partaker in the secrets of all Nature,
      and solve the mystery of existence,&mdash;there was a singing in his ears
      as of voices triumphant, which swelled with the passion of a mighty
      anthem,&mdash;and with the quietest mind and calmest brain he found
      himself musing on life and death as if he were already a witness apart, of
      their strange phenomena. Thord's appearance on the same ship in which he
      and Lotys were passengers, seemed to him quite simple and natural,&mdash;Thord's
      death moved him to a certain grave compassion,&mdash;but the whole swift
      circumstance had been so dreamlike, that he had no time to think of it, or
      regret it,&mdash;and the only active consciousness his mind held was that
      he and Lotys were journeying to 'the other side';&mdash;that 'other side'
      which he now felt so near and sure, that he could almost declare he saw
      the living presence of the woman he loved arisen from the dead and
      standing near him!
    </p>
    <p>
      The ocean widened out interminably, and he saw, looking ahead, a great
      heap of gigantic billows, leaping, sparkling, tossing, climbing over each
      other in the fitful light of the moon, like huge sea-monsters waiting to
      devour and engulf him. He smiled as he felt the yielding craft on which he
      stood swirl towards those breakers, and begin to part asunder,&mdash;so
      would he have smiled on a battlefield facing his foes, and fronted with
      fiery cannon! The glory of Empire,&mdash;the splendour of Sovereignty,&mdash;the
      pride and panoply of Temporal Power! How infinitely trivial seemed all
      these compared with the mighty force of a resistless love! How slight the
      boasted 'supremacy' of man with his laws and creeds, matched against the
      wrath of the conflicting sea,&mdash;the sure and swift approach of
      inexorable Death! Under the depths of the ocean which this ruler of a
      kingdom traversed for the last time, lay a lost Continent,&mdash;fallen
      dynasties&mdash;forgotten civilisations, wonderful and endless&mdash;kings
      and queens and heroes once famous&mdash;and now as blotted out of memory
      as though they had never been!
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  "If thou could'st see a thousand fathoms down,
  Thou would'st behold 'mid rock and shingle brown&mdash;
  The shapeless wreck of temple, tower and town,&mdash;
  The bones of Empires sleeping their last sleep,
  Their names as dead as if they never bore
    Crown or dominion!"
</pre>
    <p>
      With keen and watchful eyes he measured the swiftly lessening distance
      between him and the glittering, tumbling whirlpool of waves&mdash;he felt
      the weight of the wind bearing against the drifting vessel&mdash;the end
      was very near! Standing by the dead Lotys, he prayed silently&mdash;prayed
      strangely,&mdash;in words borrowed from no Church formula, but as they
      came, straight from his heart&mdash;prayed that God might not be a Dream&mdash;that
      Love might not be a Snare&mdash;and Death might not be an End! So do we
      all pray when the last dread moment of dissolution comes&mdash;when no
      priest's can comfort us&mdash;and when the greatest King in the world is
      but a poor ordinary human soul, ignorant and forlorn, shuddering on the
      verge of eternal Judgment!
    </p>
    <p>
      A mountainous billow broke over the deck, half stunning him with the shock
      of its cold onslaught, and sweeping the coffin of Lotys almost over the
      edge of the vessel. He threw himself beside that dreary casket, fastening
      his own body with strong rope knotted many times, to its heavy leaden
      mass, resolved to sink with it painlessly, and without a struggle. So,&mdash;in
      perfect passiveness,&mdash;he awaited his end. Suddenly,&mdash;as if a
      bell had chimed in the distance, or a voice had sung some old familiar
      song in his ears,&mdash;he saw, clearly visioned in all the flying spray
      of the tempest a face!&mdash;not the face of Lotys&mdash;but a soft,
      childish, piteous little countenance, framed in curling tendrils of hair,
      with trusting sweet eyes, raised to his own in holiest, simplest
      confidence! So pure, so fair a face!&mdash;so pathetically loving!&mdash;where
      had he seen it before? All at once he remembered,&mdash;and sprang up with
      a sharp cry of pain. Why, why had this frail ghost of the past flown out
      of the darkness of sea and storm to confront him now? The ghost of his
      first young love!&mdash;the clinging, fond, credulous creature who had
      gone to her death uncomplainingly for his sake&mdash;with only the one
      little cry of farewell&mdash;'My love! Forgive me!' Why should he think of
      her?&mdash;why should he see her before him at this supreme moment when
      Death stared him in the face, and his spirit hovered on the edge of
      Infinity? "Vengeance is mine!&mdash;I will repay, saith the Lord!" His
      first love!&mdash;so lightly won&mdash;so cruelly betrayed! Tears rushed
      to his eyes,&mdash;he thought of the wrong done to a perfectly pure and
      blameless life&mdash;a wrong he had forgotten in all these years&mdash;till
      now!
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh God!" he cried aloud&mdash;"Forgive me! Forgive my weakness, my
      selfishness, my many wasted years! Let not her face forever come between
      thy redeeming Angel, Lotys, and my soul!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The tumultuous breakers rushing now with a great swoop at the vessel,
      snatched and tore at him. He nerved himself to look again,&mdash;once
      again, and for the last time, across the great wilderness of warring
      waters! The moon now shone brightly,&mdash;the clouds were parting on
      either side of her, rolling up in huge masses, white and glistening as
      Alpine peaks of snow&mdash;the wind had not lessened, and the fury of the
      sea was still unabated. But the fair childish face had vanished,&mdash;and
      only the clear salt spray dashed in his eyes and blinded them,&mdash;only
      the salt waves clambered round him, drawing him towards them in a cold
      embrace!
    </p>
    <p>
      "'On the other side,' my Lotys!" he said&mdash;"God be merciful to us
      both!&mdash;'on the other side'!"
    </p>
    <p>
      For one moment the breaking vessel paused shudderingly on the edge of the
      seething whirlpool of waves, which, meeting in a centre of tidal
      commotion, leaped at her, and began steadily to suck her down. For one
      moment the moonbeams fell purely on the calm upturned face of the King,
      who like others allied to him in kingship throughout history, had esteemed
      mere sovereignty valueless at the cost of Love! For kings,&mdash;though
      surrounded with flatterers and sycophants who seek to make them imagine
      themselves somewhat more than human,&mdash;are but men, with all men's
      vain sins and passions, mad weaknesses and wild dreams; and when they
      love, they love as foolishly as commoners,&mdash;and when they die, as die
      they must, there is no difference in the actual way of death than is known
      to a pauper. More gold and purple on the one side,&mdash;more straw and
      sackcloth on the other,&mdash;but the solemnity and equality of Death
      itself, is the same in both. And as this dying King well knew, the People
      care little who governs them, provided bread is cheap, and labour well
      paid. He is greatest who gives them most,&mdash;and he is the most
      applauded who allows them the most liberty of action! The personality, the
      complex nature, the character, the temptations, the mind-sufferings of a
      King, as man merely, are less than nothing to the multitude who run to
      follow and to cheer him. If he were once to complain, he would be
      condemned;&mdash;and if he asked from his crowding flatterers the bread of
      sympathy, they would give him but a stone!
    </p>
    <p>
      The moon smiled&mdash;the stars flashed fitfully through the clouds,&mdash;and
      all through the length and breadth of ocean there seemed to come the sound
      of a great psalmody, rising and filling the air. It surged on the King's
      ears, as with hands clasped on the drenched lilies strewn over the
      sleeping Lotys, he welcomed the coming Unveiling of the Beyond! And then&mdash;the
      waters rose up, and caught living and dead together, and dragged them down
      with a triumphal rush and roar,&mdash;down, down to that grand
      Unconsciousness,&mdash;that sublime Pause in the chain of existence,&mdash;that
      longer Sleep, from which we shall wake refreshed and strong again,&mdash;ready
      to learn Where we have failed, Why we have loved, and How we have lost.
      But of things temporal there shall be no duration,&mdash;neither
      Sovereignty nor Supremacy, nor Power; only Love, which makes weak the
      strongest, and governs the proudest;&mdash;and of things eternal we know
      naught save that Love, always Love, is still the centre of the Universe,
      and that even to redeem the sins of the world, God Himself could find no
      surer way than through Love, born of Woman into Life.

    <p>
      Days passed,&mdash;and angry Ocean gradually smoothed out its frowning
      furrows, spreading a surface darkly-blue and peaceful, under a cloudless
      arch of sky. And one night,&mdash;when the moon, like a golden cup in
      heaven, emptied her sparkling wine of radiance over the gently heaving
      waves, a fair ship speeding swiftly with all the force of steam and sail,
      with flags fluttering from every mast, and sounds of music echoing from
      her lighted saloons, came flying over the billows like a glorious
      white-winged bird soaring to its home on an errand of joy. On her deck
      stood Gloria,&mdash;happily ignorant of all calamity,&mdash;watching with
      dreamy, thoughtful eyes the lessening lengths of sea between her and the
      land she loved. The Crown Prince, her husband,&mdash;now King, though he
      knew it not,&mdash;stood beside her;&mdash;his handsome face brightened by
      a smile which expressed his heart's elation, his soul's deep peace and
      inward content. Naught knew these wedded lovers of the strange reception
      awaiting them; of the half-mourning, half-rejoicing people,&mdash;of
      national flags suddenly veiled in crape,&mdash;of black funeral-streamers
      set distractedly amidst gay bridal garlands;&mdash;of a widowed Queen,
      broken-hearted and despairing, weeping vainly for the love she had so long
      misprized, and had learned too late to value,&mdash;of a Crown resigned,&mdash;of
      the lost Majesty and hero of a nation's idolatry;&mdash;of the death of
      Ronsard, and the inexplicable disappearance of the famous Socialist
      leader, Sergius Thord,&mdash;and of all the strange and tragic history of
      vanished lives, even to that of Sir Roger de Launay whom no man ever saw
      again,&mdash;which it fell to their faithful friend, Heinrich von Glauben
      to relate, with passionate grief and many tears. They knew nothing. They
      only saw home and the future before them, shining in bright hues of hope
      and promise; for Love was with them,&mdash;and through Love alone&mdash;love
      for the nation, love for the people, love for each other,&mdash;they
      purposed, God willing, to faithfully fulfil whatever destiny might be
      theirs, whether fortunate or disastrous! Thus minded, they could see no
      evil in the world,&mdash;no mischief,&mdash;no ominous crossings of Fate,&mdash;they
      had all earth and all heaven in each other! And the gay ship bearing them
      onward, danced over the smiling, singing, siren waves, as if she too had a
      human heart to feel and rejoice!&mdash;and in her swift course swept
      lightly over the very spot, now tranquil and radiant, where but a short
      while since, the body of Lotys had gone down, companioned by the King.
      Gloria leaning over the deck-rail looked dreamily into the sparkling
      water.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The storm we met has left no trace!" she said; "It was but a passing
      hurricane!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Her husband came to her side, and they stood together in silence. Sweet
      harmonies floating upwards from the saloon below, where a company of
      musicians and singers were stationed to charm the evenings of the Royal
      pair with 'sounds more dulcet than Heaven's own dulcimers' held them
      attentive. The tender tones of an undetermined melody rose and fell on the
      quiet air,&mdash;they listened, drawing closer and closer to each other,
      till it seemed as if but one heart beat between them,&mdash;as if but one
      Soul aspired,&mdash;Archangel-like,&mdash;from their two lives to Heaven!
      And Gloria, with a sigh of perfect happiness, murmured softly,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "How beautiful the night! How calm the sea!"
    </p>
    <p>
      So sped they onward,&mdash;with Love to steer them; with Love to bring
      them safely through the brief cloud of sorrow and wonder hanging over the
      kingdom to which they wended,&mdash;with Love to guide their lives through
      all difficulty and danger, and to give them all the good that Love alone
      can give! For whether the days be dark or bright,&mdash;whether tempest
      fills the air, or sunshine illumines the sky,&mdash;whether we are
      followed with fair blessing from friends, or pursued with the hate, envy
      and slander of injurious foes,&mdash;whether we drown by choice in
      tempestuous waters of passion, or float securely to the shores of peace,&mdash;whether
      our ships are bound for Death or for Life, we are safe in the hands of
      Love! And in the midst of what the world deems storm and wreckage, we can
      gaze into the deeper depths of God's meaning with trustful eyes, and sail
      on our voyage fearlessly,&mdash;on, even to the Grave and beyond it!&mdash;for
      with Love at the helm, how beautiful is the Night!&mdash;how calm the Sea!
    </p>

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

Gutenberg-tm License.

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
